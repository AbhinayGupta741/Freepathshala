Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/\">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule\">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/\"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/\">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/\">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/\">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/\">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/\">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/\">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/\">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/\">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/\">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/\">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bridget Willard <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/\">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/\">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/\">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress\">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href=\"https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/\">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4865\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"WordPress 4.8 “Evans”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:49:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:373:\"An Update with You in Mind Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!

Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1-video\" width=\"632\" height=\"342\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly?

Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Even More Developer Happiness <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/\">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like “Add New” links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings. These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

Look at the other galleries, see their demos, you’ll notice something weird &#8230; THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME!</p>\n<p>Modula is creative! Modula is dynamic! Modula doesn’t always look the same. Just have fun with it! Modula uses a new concept to build its internal grid. After you set a width and a height for the gallery, Modula will create a random but smart grid inside. The result is a dynamic, creative, interesting and attractive gallery.</p>\n<p>You can control how much randomness to use in each gallery, so you can obtain a more traditional layout by switching off the “random factor,” or you can make something much more different by incrementing this factor.</p>\n<p>Modula is a justified grid gallery because YOU decide the width and the height of the gallery, and the images to put inside. Modula will think about everything else. Images will never exceed their container.</p>\n<p>To achieve such a result, images will be cropped, but that’s not a problem at all, because you can set a custom alignment for those images where the subject is not at the center of the image.</p>\n<p>Modula Grid Gallery is not only responsive but also fluid, which means you’ll see images organize themselves with an impressive animation even on mobile devices thanks to the CSS3 engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Ease of use doesn’t mean trivial galleries, indeed!</strong><br />\nBy using the Modula Admin Panel you’re able to fine tune every aspect of the gallery. Choose a gallery size, margins between images, the color and the size of captions. Each photo can have a title and a subtitle so you’re able to best describe every image.</p>\n<h4>What is Modula good for?</h4>\n<p>Modula is also the best WordPress portfolio plugin, as it allows you to build gorgeous, creative portfolios. Applications are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>architecture</li>\n<li>art</li>\n<li>photography</li>\n<li>food blogs</li>\n<li>pets and animals</li>\n<li>tattoos</li>\n<li>travel</li>\n<li>also wedding albums.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re frustated because your current galleries looks boring and too standard then you can use the importer which is included with Modula. The importer is currently able to import Envira and NextGen galleries.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This plugin is maintained and supported by Macho Themes.<br />\n  Check out some of the other <a href=\"//machothemes.com/plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress plugins</a> we&#8217;ve developed.<br />\n  Check out some of the other <a href=\"//machothemes.com/themes/free/\" rel=\"nofollow\">free WordPress themes</a> we&#8217;ve developed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\";s:3:\"faq\";s:2625:\"\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<h4>For automatic installation:</h4>\n<p>The simplest way to install is to click on \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; then \\&#8217;Add\\&#8217; and type \\&#8217;Modula\\&#8217; in the search field.</p>\n<h4>For manual installation 1:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Login to your website and go to the Plugins section of your admin panel.</li>\n<li>Click the Add New button.</li>\n<li>Under Install Plugins, click the Upload link.</li>\n<li>Select the plugin zip file (modula.x.x.x.zip) from your computer then click the Install Now button.</li>\n<li>You should see a message stating that the plugin was installed successfully.</li>\n<li>Click the Activate Plugin link.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>For manual installation 2:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>You should have access to the server where WordPress is installed.

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href=\"https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin also allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel=\"next\"</code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href=\"https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href=\"https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href=\"https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages.

More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/\">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/\">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/\">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/\">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

This should also avoid namespace problems.)</li>\n<li>Improved speed and optimized settings handling (Settings and pages are only loaded if the sitemap generation process starts and not every time a page loads. This saves one MySQL Query on every request.)</li>\n<li>Added Button to restore default configuration (Messed up the config?

Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP.

The success of previous events has generated momentum to continue the 24-hour global translation sprints and has also increased the visibility of the Polyglots team&#8217;s contributions. These sprints have provided a catalyst for the team&#8217;s growth from 5,000 contributors in April 2015 to 17,000 in November 2016. The greater WordPress community has also grown in tandem, as reliable translations are the lifeblood of international WordPress usage.</p>\n<p>One way of measuring the growth of the global community is the checking the status of local meetups. After the addition of the dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8, the community has seen a sharp rise in <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">meetup group</a> growth, according to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">recent stats</a> from the community team. The widget displays local WordPress events for logged-in users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program,&#8221; Hugh Lashbrooke said. &#8220;This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordpress-meetups.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Much of that growth can be attributed to the growth of the international WordPress community, which has continued to advance the concept of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/07/18/regional-camps-take-2/\" target=\"_blank\">regional WordCamps</a> for countries and continents. These include events such as WordCamp Netherlands, WordCamp Europe, and the planned WordCamp Asia, that bring larger groups of WordPress enthusiasts together around a common region.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the WordPress community hosted 80 WordCamps in 29 countries. At the conclusion of 2016, there were 115 total WordCamps hosted in 41 different countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; usage</a> continues to grow every year, and the percentage of non-English-speaking users is also expanding. In 2014, non-English WordPress downloads surpassed English downloads for the first time.</p>\n<p>Last July, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-stats-page-redesigned-adds-new-data-on-installs-by-langauge\" target=\"_blank\">53.9% of WordPress sites used the English (US) locale</a>. That number has dropped to 50% as of today, as international usage continues to rise.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordpress-locales-july-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Stats from WordPress.org July 2017\n<p>Rahul Bansal&#8217;s lightning talk at WordCamp Europe identified one example of <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/06/21/rahul-bansal-how-translation-sprints-helps-bring-in-new-contributors/\" target=\"_blank\">how the translation sprints are bringing in new contributors in India</a>. In the past, meetup groups have had a problem with retaining new users, who often come to their first meetup lacking both a sense of belonging and confidence in contributing. Bansal and other Polyglots members had an idea to remove this block to contributing by getting new users involved in translating WordPress.</p>\n<p>During the last global translation day event, Bansal helped organize a local group to translate WordPress core into Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati. They also translated the subtitles for the WordPress 4.6 release video. The key was that the leaders did not participate in translating strings but rather focused on guiding new translators &#8211; 90% ended up being first-time contributors.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.6 shipped with support for 50 languages and the complete Gujarati translation was added to core just a few days before the release. Its inclusion in the release made WordPress more accessible to approximately 65.5 million Gujarati speakers worldwide.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>The 3rd Global WordPress Translation Day falls on the same day that the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/ga11914.doc.htm\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations has designated as International Translation Day</a>, a new initiative to recognize &#8220;the role of professional translation in connection with nations and fostering peace, understanding, and development.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress has only just begun to explore its potential to democratize publishing and hasn&#8217;t even cracked the ice in terms of usage across the world&#8217;s most popular languages. Sites using the various Chinese and Arabic locales make up less than 2% of international usage, despite these languages having more than a billion native speakers combined. If WordPress adoption takes off in these parts of the world, it will create a whole new wave of contribution and vastly expand the world market for commercial plugins and themes. The Polyglots team are on the forefront of making this possible.</p>\n<p>The first two WPTranslationDay events were held in April and November of 2016.

I’m a female developer but I’ve never really felt like that is anything too special and more importantly I have rarely felt like my gender mattered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a kid I thought I would become an artist or a dancer. It wasn’t until I had to choose the university to apply to that I decided to go with something more practical so I went with Computer Science. I hadn’t really done much with code before that, except for having a Lord of the Rings discussion board with my friends and making doing some HTML &amp; CSS related to that. After the first year of school I was already making my first WordPress sites to paying customers.</p>\n<p>After graduating I have been a full-time employee in a developer position as well as a freelancer. I’ve worked both in Finland and in the USA. During my career I have actually been surprised how easy it has been for me, a woman in the male-dominated industry, to find work, to get promoted and to get recognition. I have not faced much discrimination or prejudice related to my gender, and the great professionals I have got to work with have always been interested in my skills beyond anything else.</p>\n<p>So how come there is such a huge gender gap in the industry? I’ve witnessed it myself many times &#8211; being the only woman in a WordPress meetup of thirty people, or not having to queue at all to women’s bathroom in a tech conference with over 1000 attendees. There is no doubt that women are as capable as men, so whatever the reason is I really hope the future women would see the fun, problem-solving profession of a programmer as a great career option.</p>\n<h3>A few tips for an aspiring developer</h3>\n<p>I want to encourage everyone considering a developer career to take action and go for it. The tech industry is full of very clever and inspiring people and I promise you will not be bored. More importantly it is a safe career choice: the job market is great and the companies and the different tech communities are generally very open and welcoming. If you want to be a woman person in tech, remember:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do not accept <del>gender</del> any discrimination</strong><br />\nOne great thing about being a developer is the current status of the job market. There is a lot more demand than there is supply, so you can choose who you work with. Do not put up with discrimination, talk about it openly and stand against it. I’ve been lucky enough not to face much judgement based on my gender. I’ve worked both in Finland and in the US and the biggest challenges I’ve faced have been clients that have been surprised that a woman is the tech lead in their project. Usually after a few hours of working together the prejudice disappears &#8211; it has always been enough to just be professional and stay true to myself.</li>\n<li><strong>Be active and give back</strong><br />\nIt is important to be active in your community and help other people out in their careers. Everyone benefits from a striving local community and also it is a great opportunity to make new connections and open new doors in your career.Being an organiser of WordCamp Finland &amp; WordPress Helsinki meetup group for the last few years has really given me more than it has taken. I’ve learnt a lot and met many inspiring people, and it has opened up new career options for me too. The best thing tho has been just seeing the Finnish community grow so much and get more active by the day.</li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s skills that matter</strong><br />\nThis is really what it comes down to. Are you developing your skills constantly? Are you willing to keep up with the industry? You do not have to be the best developer, but you should be confident in your skills and be willing to always learn new ones. I believe that this is the only thing that matters in the end &#8211; not your gender.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Your%20Skills%20Speak%20Louder%20Than%20Your%20Gender&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F&title=Your+Skills+Speak+Louder+Than+Your+Gender\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/080217-min-150x150.jpg&description=Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/\" title=\"Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/\">Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:00:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Sonja Jaakkola\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: July 2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4885\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5643:\"<p>After a particularly busy month <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2017/\">in June</a>, things settled down a bit in the WordPress world — WordPress 4.8’s release went very smoothly, allowing the Core team to build up some of the community infrastructure around development. Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/\">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule\">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/\">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core. To get further involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The WordPress mobile apps have been updated with <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/a-brand-new-editor-for-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\">a brand new text editor</a>.</li>\n<li>In a recent push to encourage WordPress users to upgrade their PHP versions, two features have been proposed &#8211; one <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41191\">to provide a notice to users</a> and another to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">allow PHP version requirements to be specified by plugins and themes</a>.</li>\n<li>John Maeda wrote <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/07/14/whywordpress2/\">a great post</a> celebrating the freedom that WordPress offers.</li>\n<li>Gutenberg, the new text editor for WordPress, is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-28th-july/\">in continual development</a> — everyone is invited to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>.</li>\n<li>The WordPress Meta team is starting <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/07/26/experiment-wordcamp-org-bug-scrubs/\">a new initiative</a> to bring the community together to focus on fixing bugs across the WordCamp.org network.</li>\n<li>Volunteer applications for WordCamp US <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/2017/08/01/wcus-needs-you-volunteer-applications-are-now-open/\">are now open</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:50:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.2 Brings Major Improvements to the Contact Form Module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73816\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-2-brings-major-improvements-to-the-contact-form-module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2280:\"<p>Jetpack&#8217;s <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/contact-form/\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Form module</a> hasn&#8217;t seen too many changes since its first release (<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2012/04/24/jetpack-1-3-released-contact-forms/\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.3</a>) in 2012.

At the bottom of the form users can click a button to add new fields. These interface updates bring the module more in line with other leading contact form plugins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jetpack-updated-contact-form.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Jetpack 5.2 also improves the recommended features list for new users with better explanations of the features and benefits of each. The release also reduces the plugin&#8217;s zip file by 500kb and reduces the code required to run the Comment Likes module.</p>\n<p>Comment Likes were introduced in <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/07/05/jetpack-5-1-comment-likes/\" target=\"_blank\">version 5.1</a>, offering users a new way of interacting within the comments. Hovering over the number of likes will display the Gravatars of the users who liked the comment. The feature does not require Jetpack Comments to be enabled. The two work independently of each other.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/comment-likes.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In attempting to add Comment Likes to the Tavern, we found the module has a conflict with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch/\" target=\"_blank\">Epoch</a> commenting plugin plugin.

WordPress&#8217; notification system is often abused and overused by plugin authors who want to inject upsells and announcements into the admin. These can stack up like a pile of junk mail vying for users&#8217; attention when they are trying to manage their sites. Ultimately, notice overload decreases users&#8217; enjoyment of the software and may contribute to making it a chore to log into WordPress.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dobby/\" target=\"_blank\">Dobby plugin</a> from <a href=\"https://tfrommen.de\" target=\"_blank\">Thorsten Frommen</a> attempts to solve this problem by capturing and hiding unwanted admin notices. Frommen, a WordPress engineer at Inpsyde, was inspired to create the plugin after he saw a recent tweet from Torsten Landsiedel showing &#8220;Everyday life in the WordPress dashboard.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">Alltag im WordPress Dashboard. <a href=\"https://t.co/lofO7544uL\">pic.twitter.com/lofO7544uL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Torsten Landsiedel (@zodiac1978) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zodiac1978/status/886646392730648577\">July 16, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dobby rolls up WordPress admin notices and keeps them hidden behind a &#8220;Reveal&#8221; button that toggles a color-coded list of notices into view. It captures all the notices that are printed via the admin notice hooks, such as <code>network_admin_notices</code>, <code>user_admin_notices</code>, <code>admin_notices</code> and <code>all_admin_notices</code>. Dobby will post an admin notice if any notices have been captured.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dobby.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Frommen said the target audience for his plugin is &#8220;all the people sick and tired of too many admin notifications, which are oftentimes of no real value at all.&#8221; Dobby has a filter available for users to define what &#8220;too many&#8221; means for themselves. The <a href=\"https://github.com/tfrommen/Dobby\" target=\"_blank\">plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository</a> has examples of how to use the Dobby filter threshold, which lets users customize the minimum number of admin notices required to trigger Dobby to start hiding them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It certainly is possible that people may miss (critical) messages with Dobby being active,&#8221; Frommen said. &#8220;However, Dobby is smart enough to style his admin notice according to the most critical one captured. This means that Dobby&#8217;s notice will have error styling if there was an error notice captured. If the most critical one was a warning, that’s what Dobby’s notice will be as well. Otherwise, it’s an info notice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Within the first 10 minutes of requesting translations after announcing that Dobby was on WordPress.org, Frommen received German and Dutch translations for the plugin. The plugin UI has only two strings, which makes it a simple, 5-minute translation job.</p>\n<p>Frommen is considering adding a filter for people to define what kind of notices they would like Dobby to capture. He welcomes suggestions, <a href=\"https://github.com/tfrommen/Dobby\" target=\"_blank\">contributions on GitHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-dobby\" target=\"_blank\">more translations</a> from the WordPress community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Aug 2017 18:30:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.6.0 Changes Text/Paragraph Block Behavior, Adds New Cover Text and Read More Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73735\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-6-0-changes-textparagraph-block-behavior-adds-new-cover-text-and-read-more-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8165:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paragraph.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: A Tiny Break From The Rain <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/78814955@N00/34165889514\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f430.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Adventures In Wonderland &#038; Through The Looking Glass<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f430.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-28th-july/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 0.6.0</a> was released over the weekend with significant changes to the way paragraphs are created within text blocks. In previous versions of the plugin, pressing enter would create a line break inside a paragraph. This release modifies the behavior of the text/paragraph block to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1989\" target=\"_blank\">split the block when a user presses enter</a>. (Line breaks can still be created by pressing SHIFT+ENTER.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gutenberg-new-paragraph.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This update is a small improvement in that it hides the text formatting bar when you continue on with a new paragraph, but the slightest scroll or move of the mouse brings it back into view. Contributors are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1812#issuecomment-314045186\" target=\"_blank\">considering adding a buffer</a> at some point that would only trigger the UI after the mouse moves a certain number of pixels.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the &#8220;New Paragraph&#8221; placeholder text is intrusive and distracting. It is a constant, unwanted reminder of the structure of your document, which is not helpful if you are trying to stay in the flow of writing.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg may improve the experience of vertically stacking differently formatted content, but the writing experience still needs a great deal of work before it can be comparable to what WordPress currently provides. The new editor still gets in the way of writing, instead of silently enabling it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I love Gutenberg so far, but this is too many dongles to display at the moment of focusing on writing. <a href=\"https://t.co/Xpb19KgG01\">pic.twitter.com/Xpb19KgG01</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniel Bachhuber (@danielbachhuber) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber/status/889944454643064832\">July 25, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>After browsing the Gutenberg repository&#8217;s 400+ issues queue, it&#8217;s clear that contributors are aware of the jarring experience for writers and are working to improve it in every release.

New blocks are being developed simultaneously with core editing features. Some testers have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-5-0-adds-new-verse-block-for-poetry-and-a-new-display-for-recent-blocks#comment-224944\" target=\"_blank\">bemoaned the proliferation of blocks</a> that may seldom be used while the basic writing experience continues to lag behind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin reviews</a> are currently averaging 2.3 out of 5 stars on WordPress.org, with 46 1-star reviews, 21 5-star reviews, and a handful in between. While the reviews are not a full representation of all who are testing Gutenberg, they provide a small window into users&#8217; current expectations, delights, and frustrations with the editor. Gutenberg contributors are monitoring these forums and using the feedback to create bug reports.</p>\n<p>Many reviewers have left 1-star ratings, begging WordPress to keep it as a plugin instead of adding it to core. One reviewer even took to verse to further elaborate on his one-star review titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/catastophe-how-to-destroy-wordpress-in-2-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\">A Visit from St. Gutenberg</a>&#8221; with an adaptation of the classic poem &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas\" target=\"_blank\">The Night Before Christmas</a>:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nA bundle of blocks he had flung on his back,<br />\nAnd he looked like a coder just opening his pack.</p>\n<p>His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br />\n“Who needs MCE, when we have blocks and so many?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many reviewers find Gutenberg to be &#8220;unnecessarily complex&#8221; for actions that were previously easy to perform in the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have several websites &#8211; two are for business and include blogs (technical posts, how-tos, etc),&#8221; @quantaweb <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/please-make-it-a-plugin-not-part-of-core/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;I’m also the editor of a literary magazine.

It’s not easier to write blogs with it, and it does nothing to ease the work of importing critical essays and poetry into the literary magazine — and formatting them — either&#8230;Gutenberg is unnecessarily complex.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some of the 1-star reviews come laced with threats to move to another CMS and splinter the WordPress community if Gutenberg is included in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By removing all the traditional editor buttons and trying to make a minimalist design the usefulness and ease of use has been drastically reduced,&#8221; @ovann86 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-example-of-why-developers-are-not-ux-experts/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;I found myself either not being able to do very basic content management or having to click, hover and look for the buttons – instead of them being visible and available immediately&#8230;If this was made core I would likely be forced to move to another CMS.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Early testing of beta software is not for everyone, as many are unable to look past the initial bugs and clunky implementations to see the potential of the editor to improve WordPress&#8217; severely fragmented content creation experience. Matt Mullenweg jumped onto the forums as recently as two weeks ago to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-ready-for-prime-time-14/#post-9316327\" target=\"_blank\">respond to testers&#8217; feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely agree it’s not ready for prime time yet, that’s why we’re doing extensive public testing and iteration while it’s in the plugin phase,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Thank you for your feedback and I hope you try it again in a few months with an open mind.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 31 Jul 2017

at WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to meet Russian designer and developer <a href=\"https://dmtrmrv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dmitry Mayorov</a>, whose themes I had noticed earlier in the year in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/iamdmitrymayorov/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Theme Directory</a>. Mayorov&#8217;s design style is reminiscent of other niche theme developers like Anders Norén and Mike McAlister. He launched his own commercial themes business on <a href=\"https://themepatio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ThemePatio.com</a> two years ago and his free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/counter/\" target=\"_blank\">Counter</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/maker/\" target=\"_blank\">Maker</a> themes collectively have more than 3,000 active installs on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/counter.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maker.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Mayorov started taking part in meetups in Russia in 2013. Following WordCamp Moscow 2015, Konstantin Kovshenin asked him if he would take on the role of lead organizer. Mayorov is organizing <a href=\"https://2017.moscow.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Moscow 2017</a>, which is scheduled for August 12. In our interview below, he describes a few of the challenges organizers face in uniting the Russian WordPress community that is spread out over such a large land mass.</p>\n<p>Mayorov also discusses how he began creating WordPress themes and how clients&#8217; needs influenced his <a href=\"https://themepatio.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">theme development philosophy</a>. He aspires to create themes that are fast, content-focused, and minimalistic, without the bloat of hundreds of font options and pre-built site layouts. Mayorov also gave us his predictions for the future of the theme industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to go two directions at the same time,&#8221; Mayorov said. &#8220;I think that page builders and multi-purpose themes wont go anywhere but I also think that niche themes are here to stay as well. Not everybody is looking for a page builder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see the tendency that at first when people get introduced to WordPress they discover theme marketplaces. They think, &#8216;Ok this is the top seller, I&#8217;m going to go with this theme.&#8217; For some people it works, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, because sometimes you have challenges where you need to create a website like yesterday&#8230;Once they see that there is another way, they start to research other theme developers and shops, realizing that there are simple themes that work faster and are easier to use, and that you don&#8217;t need to spend two hours trying to create the homepage. They will use those themes as well. These are the themes I&#8217;m trying to build.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 19:57:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Customize Snapshots 0.6.0 Adds the Ability to Name and Merge Changesets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73700\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/customize-snapshots-0-6-0-adds-the-ability-to-name-and-merge-changesets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5032:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/snapshots.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/T80PGTWXHZ\">Freestocks.org</a>\n<p>Contributors to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/\" target=\"_blank\">Customize Snapshots</a> feature plugin are steadily building a UI for managing Customizer changesets using the changesets infrastructure added in WordPress 4.7. <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2017/07/27/customize-snapshots-0-6-release/\" target=\"_blank\">Version 0.6.0</a> of the plugin was released this month with an expanded interface for managing the complexities of multi-user editing in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>The previous version of Customize Snapshots already supported scheduling but this release introduces a new multi-select save button that allows users to publish, save draft, save as pending, or schedule changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/customize-snapshots-multi-select-button.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.6.0 adds the ability to name changesets, which is especially helpful for site owners who are sorting and previewing changes submitted by multiple editors. The list of changesets has links for previewing on the frontend, editing in the Customizer, or inspecting the changeset&#8217;s content on the edit post screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saved-changesets.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release introduces the ability to merge multiple changesets into a single changeset, which users can then preview and publish all at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/merge-changesets.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Contributors have not yet worked out how this feature will handle conflicting changes submitted by multiple users. It currently accepts whatever change was made more recently, but this isn&#8217;t ideal in certain situations. <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20conflict\" target=\"_blank\">Conflict resolution</a> is on the team&#8217;s radar to address in future iterations of the plugin and they are discussing several different approaches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Merging changesets would definitely lie in the realm of a power user feature,&#8221; Customize component co-maintainer Weston Ruter said. &#8220;It would probably not be proposed for core. Nevertheless, the existence of the feature is a demonstration of the kinds of things that can be possible when working with changesets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to co-leading WordPress&#8217; Customizer team, Ruter is also the CTO at XWP, where several of the agency&#8217;s clients are actively using the Customize Snapshots plugin. News Corp Australia and Beachbody are two companies that have invested in the plugin&#8217;s development and are successfully using it at scale on their network of sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When paired with the Customize Posts plugin, it gets really powerful because you can edit multiple posts and pages, along with any of their postmeta, while also editing widgets, nav menus, and any other settings, and all of these changes are all bundled together in a single changeset,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;This changeset can then be previewed on the frontend, including by sharing the URL with an unauthenticated user (like a 3rd party who can&#8217;t even access the Customizer), and they can click around the site with all of the customizations applied as if they had been published.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter said the Customizer team isn&#8217;t currently targeting a WordPress release for getting these new UI additions added to core but rather view the progress as &#8220;prototypes for what could be merged into core, bit by bit.&#8221; He identified several tickets that the plugin provides prototype interfaces for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\" target=\"_blank\">#28721</a>: Scheduled changes for the customizer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31089\" target=\"_blank\">#31089</a>: Add revisions and statuses for changesets</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21666\" target=\"_blank\">#21666</a>: Customizer reset/undo/revert</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\" target=\"_blank\">#39896</a>: Customizer: Allow users to Draft changes before Publishing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Core development is still very much focused on the editor — Gutenberg — so the far-reaching Customizer changes are not being emphasized yet,&#8221; Ruter said. Meanwhile progress continues on the Customize Snapshots plugin, which was completely rewritten for the 0.6.0 release after most of its infrastructure was merged into WordPress 4.7. Ruter&#8217;s team is not sure which features will eventually land in core, but the various Customizer feature plugins give users an idea of the power of the changesets infrastructure that is already included in WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:58:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: .blog Passes 100,000 Registrations, 66.5% of Purchased Domains are in Use\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/blog-passes-100000-registrations-66-5-of-purchased-domains-are-in-use\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5297:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The .blog domain extension, managed by Automattic subsidiary Knock Knock WHOIS There (KKWT), opened registration to the public in November 2016 and has just <a href=\"https://my.blog/2017/07/26/100000-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">passed the 100,000 registration milestone</a>. The extension is averaging 300 new .blog domains registered per day and is quickly gaining popularity among new generic TLDs. According to the most recent stats available at nTLDStats, <a href=\"https://ntldstats.com/tld/blog\" target=\"_blank\">.blog registrations</a> have climbed steadily and predictably every month since its public launch.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-registrations.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>.blog registrations according to ntldstats.com\n<p>Automattic, which operates independently from KKWT as a registrar, currently has the largest market share of .blog domain registrars at 62.8%. Other smaller pieces of the pie continue to see increasing numbers of registrations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/registrar-market-share-blog.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;When a .blog domain is sold through any .blog registrar, it operates like all other top-level domains (TLDs),&#8221; .blog representative Erica Varlese said. &#8220;This means that the registry, in this case Knock Knock WHOIS There, receives the wholesale cost, ICANN receives their fees, and the registrar retains the rest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The .blog team has started experimenting with different marketing programs to promote the extension among registrars and launched its first campaigns last month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These programs are available to any .blog accredited registrar and, through participation, allows them to provide .blog domains to their customers at a discounted rate,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;It is designed to test price elasticity and various end-user marketing techniques that best fit each registrars&#8217; unique customer-base.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Registration for .blog domains is fully integrated into WordPress.com&#8217;s domain offerings, but Varlese said that Knock Knock WHOIS There, as a separate company, is not informed of the specific details of their domain roadmap. The subsidiary also does not track how many of the .blog domains are running WordPress, as the extension is platform agnostic and in use across many different blogging services. </p>\n<p>So far .blog domain customers include both individuals and businesses, including some e-commerce and community sites. Varlese said the main benefit to acquiring a .blog domain is that customers are more likely to get and use a name they always wanted (example.blog), versus settling for a more complicated variation, such as blog.example.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using a blog domain is also a great way to embrace engagement with your community,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;In addition to individual and personal bloggers, we also see larger brands using blogs to engage with their customers. Visiting <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.blog\" target=\"_blank\">stackoverflow.blog</a>, for example, is intuitive. The domain lets me know right away what type of content and interaction to expect versus what my expectations would be when prompted to visit stackoverflow.com. Both are equally important and both add value to the customer’s online experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many people purchase a domain just to sit on it for the right time to use it or sell. Greater usage of .blog domains promotes visibility on the web, which is why registrars place value on how many have launched websites using the extension. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is steady, long-term growth while continuing to increase our usage rates,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;We want every .blog domain to resolve to a unique content site or blog. Usage is an important metric for us. It positively contributes to help the new TLD marketplace thrive and grow organically. It is at the forefront of every decision we make, including marketing and rebate programs for our registrars, as well as our dotblogger program, which gives online influencers easy access to all .blog domains, including premium and reserved domains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The .blog team&#8217;s 100,000 registrations milestone post cites usage stats from Pandalytics, a domains data service, that are not publicly available. </p>\n<p>&#8220;66.5% of .blog domains have a unique website associated with them, compared to an average of 39.3% for both new and legacy TLDs, according to recent research by Daniel Ruzzini-Mejia (co-founder and CSO of DomainsBot Srl, the company behind big-data analysis platform Pandalytics),&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;Ruzzini-Mejia also found more than 250 .blog domains that use an eCommerce platform.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This is an interesting find in an era where many have claimed that blogs are dead. If the indie web proponents have their way, blogs may have another renaissance yet, and could become the anchors of commerce and identity online. The healthy usage numbers the .blog extension has posted in its first year are a strong indicator that the concept of blogging still holds an important place on the web. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 18:09:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Adobe to Discontinue Flash Support and Updates in 2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73654\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/adobe-to-discontinue-flash-support-and-updates-in-2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3530:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/adobe-flash.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Adobe <a href=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that it will discontinue Flash support and updates at the end of 2020. Flash played an important part in the history of the web, inspiring many of the open standards and formats that the web has moved on to embrace.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Given this progress, and in collaboration with several of our technology partners – including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla – Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash. Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year most major browsers moved to block Flash, requiring users to enable it manually for sites where they wish to view Flash content. Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla were on deck today with announcements of their own regarding future Flash support. Firefox is the most aggressive with its <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2017/07/25/firefox-roadmap-flash-end-life/\" target=\"_blank\">plan to disable Flash for most users in 2019</a>. Only those running an Extended Support Release will be able to continue using it through the end of 2020 and no version of Firefox will load the plugin after Adobe discontinues security patches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/saying-goodbye-flash-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome is also phasing out support for Flash</a> and plans to remove it completely from the browser toward the end of 2020.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Three years ago, 80 percent of desktop Chrome users visited a site with Flash each day,&#8221; Google Chrome Product Manager Anthony Laforge said. &#8220;Today usage is only 17 percent and continues to decline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This trend reveals that sites are migrating to open web technologies, which are faster and more power-efficient than Flash. They’re also more secure, so you can be safer while shopping, banking, or reading sensitive documents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Microsoft Edge team also <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/07/25/flash-on-windows-timeline/#QKXFIeE23ZSoZLlh.97\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> its plans to phase out Flash from both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer with complete removal from all supported versions of Microsoft Windows by the end of 2020.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://blog.kongregate.com/html5-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML5 adoption is growing among game developers</a>, Adobe&#8217;s announcement means major changes for segments of the the gaming, education, and video industries that have not yet migrated to newer, open formats. This news will also make obsolete dozens of WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/flash/\" target=\"_blank\">plugins that were created to upload and display Flash content</a>.</p>\n<p>Adobe&#8217;s announcement was met with thanks and &#8220;good riddance,&#8221; with many calling for an even speedier timeline. Many are also concerned about all the orphaned content and .swf games on the web that Flash&#8217;s disappearance will create. Adobe has received many requests on Twitter for the company to consider open sourcing the old Flash Player codebase for the sake of compatibility and archiving content. Adobe has not officially replied to any of these requests.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 04:01:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"HeroPress: Random Diary Chapters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1992\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=random-diary-chapters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7701:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072617-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress combines people together from all over the world.

How about people? Ordinary people are heroes to me. People who are willing to help one another. People just like you and me.</p>\n<p>Well, at least like you <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> &#8211; if you’re for some reason reading my diary.</p>\n<h2>Who’s teaching who</h2>\n<p>I still remember when I build my first website with table layouts while studying math in the University of Jyväskylä. Those were the days! But it doesn’t feel like yesterday anymore. More like day before.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless being a math teacher has been the perfect choice for me. It’s been fun, challenging, and rewarding. I’ve probably learnt lot more from students than they have from me.</p>\n<p>Heck, they even got me into WordPress when I was taking my ex-students short film course. Was it 2008? Something like that. We needed a website for our short film and had only 1-2 days. Students gave me link to WordPress.com and I was sold. Getting site up and running was easy and fast.</p>\n<p>“Well come here and do it yourself!!” &#8211; drama class student shouted.</p>\n<p>That’s another good lesson I’ve learnt.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s so easy to give negative feedback (don’t do it like that) without doing anything yourself or giving constructive feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh boy I still feel ashamed when I judged a book by it’s cover. This time the book cover was a blonde girl asking weird questions with high voice. I was a prison of my prejudice and instantly assumed she must be bad at math. How wrong was I. She was brilliant.</p>\n<p>At least the prison gate is now open if I just understand to walk out.</p>\n<h2>Who am I</h2>\n<p>Sometimes I wonder what other people think of me? Do they think I’m open minded teacher, or front-developer who cares about accessibility. But does any of that matter? Job title really doesn’t tell anything who I am. Or anybody else.</p>\n<p>But who am I? I’m not sure how to define me. I’m no dad or husband. I do have several good traits but there are also demons inside me. Lack of empathy is one of them. And that comes down to this:</p>\n<p>In the end <strong>I’m a selfish asshole</strong>.</p>\n<p>It’s okay to be selfish from time to time but it’s not okay to let people down big time when they need me most. Being an ordinary human being is not one of my strengths but I’ll promise to work on it.</p>\n<h2>Friends will be friends</h2>\n<p>I consider myself lucky. I have lovely parents and two crazy big brothers. And over the years I have made friendships that last forever.</p>\n<p>I hope everybody have a friend who is like a bridge between other friends. Someone who is always organizing something fun: bowling, music gigs, dinners, sports. Someone who is always nice to others and would never hurt a fly.</p>\n<p>I had a friend like that.</p>\n<p>But as a return I couldn’t help him enough. Shadows of life had taken over him. He could not see the light anymore. He died by suicide before christmas 2015.</p>\n<p>Now he can’t fall anymore. He will always be our beloved one and we’ll miss him more than words can express. So many songs reflects to memories we have. For example this Finnish song that I heard exactly one year after his death. (<a href=\"http://lyricstranslate.com/en/rakastettu-beloved.html\">Lyrics in english</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"></div>\n<p>Why is it so much easier to talk about other problems but not your own. Why is it so hard to ask help when you really need it.</p>\n<h2>Life goes on</h2>\n<p>Do I need to say anything. No I don&#8217;t.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/summer-of-2017-peaceful-mind-after-sauna.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1995\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/summer-of-2017-peaceful-mind-after-sauna.jpg\" alt=\"View of the water form the shore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" /></a>Summer 2017.

Prior to the acquisition SiteLock protected 6 million sites, with 2.2 million of them running on WordPress. The addition of Patchman extends SiteLock&#8217;s customer base to 12 million sites and more than 4 million of those are powered by WordPress.</p>\n<p>Patchman detects vulnerabilities in <a href=\"https://patchman.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200236661-Which-applications-does-Patchman-scan-and-fix-\" target=\"_blank\">a wide range of popular applications</a> and quarantines and patches threats automatically. The quarantine feature neutralizes malicious files by removing them from public access. Patchman supports detection and patching for WordPress 3.x and later.</p>\n<p>Historically, the service has not included patches for plugins but it has applied them on a case-by-case basis for high impact vulnerabilities, including a few found in WP Super Cache, MailPoet, and the open source Genericons font project. The Patchman dashboard allows users to easily track files where vulnerabilities have been detected, view status, and revert patches if necessary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/patchman-dashboard.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Patchman&#8217;s single focus on hosting providers gives SiteLock the opportunity to offer more options to its hosting partners. With the acquisition, the company is now partering with more than 500 hosting providers, including BlueHost, 1&amp;1, Web.com, InMotion, Melbourne IT, GMO (NTT), and many others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During our early talks, Patchman was not looking to be acquired and SiteLock wasn’t looking to acquire,&#8221; SiteLock President Neill Feather said. After meeting at the WorldHostingDays show in Rust, Germany in late March this year and at another show in Los Angeles, the companies found they shared similar goals and would be in a better position working together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It truly was a matter of 1+1=3,&#8221; Feather said. &#8220;Traditionally, SiteLock is very strong in detecting and removing malware for end users. Patchman offers a service tailored specifically to hosting providers and aimed at fixing the security vulnerabilities that hackers exploit to infect websites with malware. By working together we are able to address a wider market and offer a broader solution to the problems that we solve for our customers. We can now attack the problem from multiple angles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Patchman&#8217;s technology will compliment SiteLock&#8217;s existing security features but the company has not yet decided how it will be incorporated into its security plans for customers. Feather said the team is still jointly building out its future roadmap to give hosts and end customers access to a wider range of products. They are also considering making Patchman&#8217;s detection technology compatible with more products in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Feather could not disclose any specifics on revenue generated by <a href=\"https://wpdistrict.sitelock.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteLock&#8217;s WordPress security products</a> but approximately 30% of its newly expanded customer base is running on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we can say is that we’re heavily invested in the WordPress community and plan on continuing to do so,&#8221; Feather said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited that the increased number of sites we now protect across multiple platforms means we&#8217;ll be able to identify malware and malicious trends more efficiently than we&#8217;ve been able to already, and that&#8217;s good for every end user,&#8221; SiteLock&#8217;s WordPress Evangelist Adam Warner said. &#8220;Secondly, although we already have solutions for our partners, Patchman allows web hosts to offer increased security options for advanced users of their platforms. Being a WordPress guy, I&#8217;m excited about the possibility we now have to extend the capabilities of Patchman to plugins and other WordPress-specific software.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 18:46:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Watch WordCamp Varna Wapuus Get Designed in Real Time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73617\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-wordcamp-varna-wapuus-get-designed-in-real-time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1390:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wordcamp-varna-wapuus.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The very first <a href=\"https://2017.varna.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Varna</a> will be held September 2-3 at the <a href=\"https://www.ue-varna.bg/en/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Economics</a>.

The appearance of the new editor, codenamed “Aztec,&#8221; is very similar to the old one but is light years ahead of its predecessor in both speed and reliability. Aaron Douglas, iOS engineer at Automattic, announced the <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/a-brand-new-editor-for-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">open beta for Aztec</a> today with a side-by-side comparison video of the old and new editors. A copy and paste test with 500 paragraphs on iPhone 6s demonstrates Aztec&#8217;s instantaneous response while the old editor takes two-minutes to render the text.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to better speed and performance, Aztec&#8217;s use of OS-provided text controls makes it possible to offer full support for accessibility technologies like iOS’ VoiceOver and Android’s TalkBack. It also adds the ability to draft using dictation.</p>\n<p>Aztec introduces a new undo/redo tool at the top of the screen as a quick option for fixing mistakes. It also provides a simpler, more reliable experience using spell check.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/aztec-testing.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Aztec beta is available to all users in the latest updates of the app (8.0 for iOS, 7.8 for Android). After opening the app you will see a popup for enabling the new editor. It can also be toggled on/off by going to Me > App Settings and selecting &#8220;Set the Editor Type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The mobile team has made it easy to test and give feedback without leaving the app. Tapping the &#8220;beta&#8221; button at the top of the editor will open a &#8220;What&#8217;s New in the Beta&#8221; page with a bug button at the top that you can use to report bugs and send feedback. At the moment, the beta does not support shortcodes or video and WordPress gallery features. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s not 100% ready for use and heavy users of the mobile apps are likely to discover glitches.</p>\n<p>Aztec is open source (GPL 2.0) and packaged as a rich-text editor component in its own GitHub repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-iOS\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-Android\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>) so that developers can use it in their own applications and contribute code back to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Quite literally, there is nothing like this out there – every editor we could find uses a web view or has very limited support for any HTML,&#8221; Douglas said. &#8220;Our hope is the Aztec editor is seen as a component that can be used by many iOS and Android apps to provide a rich HTML editing experience. We feel that we could garner a bigger contributor base to the mobile apps simply because this component exists, is free and open, and is super awesome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project is a few months behind the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2017/04/08/introducing-the-aztec-mobile-editors/\" target=\"_blank\">schedule published in April</a>, which had open beta targeted for May and the full release for the end of this month. Depending on how well the beta testing period goes, users could see the new Aztec editor included in the mobile apps within the next few months.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 22:59:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Hamilton: A Free WordPress Portfolio Theme for Photographers, Illustrators, and Designers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72881\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/hamilton-a-free-wordpress-portfolio-theme-for-photographers-illustrators-and-designers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3779:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton</a> is a new portfolio theme released by Swedish designer and developer <a href=\"http://www.andersnoren.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Anders Norén</a> during his summer vacation. It was created for photographers, illustrators, designers, and image-heavy blogs. The theme displays portfolio items in a minimal, masonry-style grid with an optional tagline on the front page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-white-black-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Hamilton has a pretty simple design at its core, so when it was more or less finished, I decided to add a couple of fun theme options to make it more customizable,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;The main one is the Dark Mode. With a click of the mouse in the WordPress Customizer, you can change Hamilton from dark text on a white background to white text on a dark background.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Customizer also includes a few other helpful options for portfolio sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a custom background image or color</li>\n<li>Replace the navigation toggle in the header with the Primary Menu on desktop</li>\n<li>Change two-column default post grid display to three columns on desktop</li>\n<li>Display titles in the post previews</li>\n<li>Add a title to front page when it&#8217;s set to display latest posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The theme is beautifully responsive to various devices and screen sizes. Norén&#8217;s typography choices are clean and readable on mobile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-on-mobile-e1500914561475.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Hamilton includes <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/offscreen-magazine-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">styles for the default WordPress image gallery</a> with more interesting options available to create complex galleries stacked with different numbers of columns.

It gives users the option to add a simple resume to their portfolios, without having to add a plugin. The template uses basic HTML for formatting with h1 header tags, horizontal rules, and unordered lists. The template could use a bit more documentation, since not all users are familiar with HTML, but it&#8217;s a useful addition for simple portfolio sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/resume-template.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Check out a <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> along with the <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/style-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">style guide</a> to see the theme in action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton</a> is Anders Norén&#8217;s 15th theme approved for the WordPress Theme Directory.

Over the course of a few months he started going deeper into learning about writing WordPress plugins and produced <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a>, a role management plugin for WordPress. The first major overhaul of the plugin came in 2015 with version 1.0&#8217;s expansion of features and a new UI for editing roles.</p>\n<p>Members has built up a user base of more than 100,000 active installs since it first <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/09/17/members-wordpress-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">launched in 2009</a>. Tadlock estimates that over the last couple years, 40% of <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Hybrid</a> customers are primarily there for support and small tweaks to the Members plugin. He decided it was time to begin investing more in the plugin and its community.</p>\n<p>Tadlock released <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/members-version-2-0\" target=\"_blank\">Members 2.0</a> this week. The plugin manages core WordPress capabilities but 2.0 adds the ability for plugins to register custom capabilities. The labels for the capabilities can be internationalized so users can manage the plugin in their own languages in human-readable form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-human-caps.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also adds the ability to use the WordPress editor for writing custom post error messages, making it easy to direct visitors to registration or other important information regarding access to the content.</p>\n<p>Members 2.0 lets users add multiple roles when creating a new user from the Add User screen. It also introduces the ability to bulk add or remove roles from users, even when multiple roles have been enabled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-bulk-users.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version of the plugin serves some of its data using the WP REST API and a new setting was added to authenticate users who are accessing the REST API endpoints. This protects content from being exposed on sites that have the &#8220;private site&#8221; setting enabled. Tadlock plans to write a tutorial about what he has learned in integrating the REST API with the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Tadlock Aims to Monetize Members with Add-Ons, Renews Efforts to Develop a Community of Add-On Developers</h3>\n<p>Members 2.0 introduces a new Settings screen that ties in with Tadlock&#8217;s future plans to monetize the plugin. The new screen includes a view for add-ons. Tadlock has two add-ons available currently and has written an API for third-party developers to register their own add-ons to be visible on this screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-addons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is to create some small add-on plugins,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;There&#8217;s already two:  <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-levels\" target=\"_blank\">Members &#8211; Role Levels</a>, which is paid, and <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-hierarchy\" target=\"_blank\">Members &#8211; Role Hierarchy</a>, which I was hired to build and was allowed to release to the community for free. I&#8217;ve got a few small plugins like those in mind that&#8217;ll be in a lower price range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock also plans to release a more robust version of the &#8220;Content Permissions&#8221; feature as another add-on. He has received numerous feature requests from users over the years about what they would like to see in this plugin. The add-on will offer a variety of different ways to show/hide content.</p>\n<p>I asked Tadlock if he has considered building payment gateway add-ons so users can charge for memberships. He said the idea is on the table.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to build those or someone else,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve mentioned it to some other developers. It would be a good place to start building add-ons.&#8221; His current setup uses Easy Digital Downloads with a couple of plugins to bridge it with Members and ThemeHybrid.com.</p>\n<p>A plugin like Members has the potential to have a large, third-party ecosystem of plugins for payments and additional features, but Tadlock was focused on other projects during the first few years after it launched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t actively pursued the add-on angle,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Instead, I focused more on themes during most of that time. Now, I&#8217;m focusing more on plugin development. It&#8217;s my fault for not nurturing a community of add-on developers, which is something I&#8217;m trying to do more of now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock said many of the developers he knows are working with Members because they like that it gives them a solid foundation to build on for client work. He hopes to persuade some of them to release some of that code back as commercial add-ons or free plugins in the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<p>Since launching the plugin eight years ago, Tadlock has aimed to make it behave as if it were a natural part of WordPress. At its core, Members is a role and capability management plugin and not a one-size-fits all membership plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more or less a UI over what you could do with code already,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Most of all, it tries not to get in your way. Every membership site has its own unique needs. It&#8217;s tough building something that suits everyone.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d rather have that foundation of Members just exposing the roles/caps system with third-party add-ons that suit various users&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other membership plugins often try to please everyone or pigeon-hole everything into their custom system. I like more to have a bit more flexibility without the bloat.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:37:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.1 Adds a Dedicated Custom HTML Widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73470\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-1-adds-a-dedicated-custom-html-widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2681:\"<p>When WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-evans-released-featuring-nearby-wordpress-events-new-media-widgets-and-link-boundaries\">4.8 was released</a> last month, it introduced TinyMCE functionality to the Text widget. Unfortunately, this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-disable-visual-editor-in-the-text-widget/\">caused issues</a> for those who use Custom HTML as the Visual editor often strips out portions of the code.</p>\n<p>WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/#beta-and-rc\">4.8.1 Beta 1</a> is available for testing and addresses this problem by including a dedicated Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For advanced users or any user who needs to paste in HTML snippets, there is now a dedicated &#8216;Custom HTML&#8217; widget that is specifically for adding arbitrary HTML to your sidebar,&#8221; Weston Ruter, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This widget will retain the application of the <code>widget_text</code> filters, in addition to having a new dedicated <code>widget_custom_html_content</code> filter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For use cases that involve adding content to your sidebar, the Text widget will continue to feature the same Visual editing interface that the post editor has (TinyMCE).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Users who access Text widgets that have Custom HTML in WordPress 4.8.1, will see a note at the top of the widget that suggests using the Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>If a user pastes or types HTML into a text widget with the Visual editor active, WordPress displays an Admin Pointer suggesting that they use the Text tab instead or use the Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<img />Text Widget Admin Pointer\n<p>The Custom HTML widget works similar to the Text widget in WordPress 4.7 and below.</p>\n<img />Custom HTML Widget\n<p>Sites that have existing Text widgets containing custom HTML that may be modified by the Visual editor, are opened in a legacy mode.</p>\n<p>Legacy mode retains the old Text widget interface, including the checkbox on whether or not to automatically add paragraphs. This change prevents the Visual editor from altering code.</p>\n<p>Ruter says the ideal way to test these improvements is to install it on a staging site that has Text widgets containing HTML and are known to be problematic in WordPress 4.8. After upgrading, check to see if the widgets open in legacy mode.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8.1 is scheduled to be released on August 1st.

So far the GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a> has received 627 &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; emoji and 66 comments from concerned React users who are hoping for a change in licensing.</p>\n<p>Many respondents on the thread said that ASF&#8217;s decision affects their organizations&#8217; ability to continue using React in projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apache CouchDB and others will switch away from React if we have to,&#8221; CouchDB committer Robert Newson <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315596902\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather not, it&#8217;s a lot of work for no real gain, but we don&#8217;t have a choice. Changing license can be simple (RocksDB completed that change in a day).&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My team, at LinkedIn, is also having legal troubles using React for our internal projects,&#8221; LinkedIn software Denis Ivanov <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316500996\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We would love to see a change on this front.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Software developer Clark Evans <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315607798\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on how React&#8217;s current licensing might affect medical research institutes, and suggested that Facebook consider an Apache 2.0 license because it includes equitable patent grants.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since U.S. based universities rely upon patent licensing as part of their legislatively mandated technology transfer initiatives, they are growing far more cautious in their due diligence. For this reason, at some universities, software written with React may be shunned. Existing projects using React software may be asked to remove the React software software dependency. Please strongly consider this proposal, since our RexDB work is used at major universities, we do not wish to rework to use a React alternative.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion commented that they would like to use React but the licensing makes it impossible for their companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other large companies such as mine (Adobe) can&#8217;t use React, Pop, etc. for the very same reason,&#8221; Corey Lucier <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316046522\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d love to participate in the project, contribute to each, etc. but Facebook&#8217;s heavy-handed PATENTS clause is a showstopper.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even mid-size companies like mine (ViaSat) are starting to disallow the use of Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;open-source&#8217; projects for this reason,&#8221; software developer Aaron Yoshitake <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316102045\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to build React web and native apps, but it seems that any sensible legal department will recommend against agreeing to Facebook&#8217;s asymmetric patent grant.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Internal Discussions Continue at Facebook, Re-Licensing Issue has been Escalated to Engineering Directors</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, shared with participants that Facebook is having internal discussions about the re-licensing issue but cautioned them to temper their optimism. He returned to throw some ice on the conversation, which has grown more heated over the past few days, when he said it could only remain an open discussion if everyone involved remains civil. Many participants are concerned about the future of the React-based software that they have already invested thousands of hours of work into.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that everyone is frustrated about this issue,&#8221; Abramov <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316223034\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Personally I am just as frustrated to spend time, energy, and emotional wellbeing on legal mumbo jumbo that is preventing people from using React. I would much prefer to spend this time on working together to make it better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But the reality of this situation is that the maintainers of React (people like me that you’re interacting on the issue tracker) are not the ones making these decisions. Each of us is doing what we can to show different perspectives on this issue to the people who can make those decisions, and we appreciate your feedback too. But we can only keep discussion open if everyone stays civil and respectful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also pointed out in a follow-up update that a bug tracker isn&#8217;t the best avenue for a legal discussion, especially since most participants are software developers and not lawyers. Many have mistaken the thread as a way to communicate with Facebook but there are just a handful of software developers who are representing the React community&#8217;s concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have heard you very well, and we have passed on your concerns,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;But repeating the same points over and over in different threads does not help move this forward, and creates a lot of noise and stress for the maintainers who are already empathetic to your cause.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants expressed frustration that the React community cannot participate in the discussions more directly. However, as React is both an open source project and a product of Facebook, the company&#8217;s leadership has the last word on licensing issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that software developers like us are not the best people to discuss legal details,&#8221; software consultant Erik Doernenburg <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316318170\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;However, wouldn&#8217;t the logical consequence be that the Facebook Legal team, who make such decisions, become active in this forum? Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible that all relevant details pertaining to a piece of open source software are discussed in the open? It is incredibly frustrating to have such an important aspect of open software discussed behind closed doors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not known whether Facebook is considering another change to its Patents grant or a complete re-licensing. Participants in the discussion are also concerned about other Facebook open source projects like GraphQL, Relay, React Native, and Flow, which share the same BSD+Patents License and are widely used by the open source community.</p>\n<p>Dan Abramov left an <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316739812\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> today to let the community know that no resolution is available this week. However, the update seemed more positive than the first one, which discouraged participants from being optimistic about a change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to point out that there is a real momentum behind this discussion internally,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;There are going to be more meetings next week escalating this up to the engineering directors.

The intent of the survey is to provide an overview of the rapidly changing landscape of JavaScript frameworks and tools by gauging which technologies are growing in popularity and which ones people are liking and using less.</p>\n<p>The survey, created by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/SachaGreif\" target=\"_blank\">Sacha Greif</a> and <a href=\"http://michaelrambeau.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Rambeau</a>, should take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Topics include JavaScript frontend and backend tools and frameworks, state management solutions, testing tools, CSS, build tools, mobile and desktop technologies, package managers, text editors, salaries, and more.</p>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s 89-question survey received more than 9,300 responses. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-javascript-survey-results-published-react-emerges-as-clear-winner-in-front-end-frameworks\" target=\"_blank\">Results</a> showed that React ranked higher than other front-end frameworks in terms of developer satisfaction at 92%, followed closely by Vue.js at 89%.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see if and how these results change with many open source project and companies growing wary of using React after the Apache Software Foundation&#8217;s recent decision to<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies\" target=\"_blank\"> ban Apache PMC members from using any technology licensed with Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents License</a>.

This is the third WordCamp to be held in Croatia, following WordCamp Rijeka (2015) and WordCamp Split (2016). Although it changes cities every year, the camp is known as Croatia’s annual WordCamp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having WordCamp change cities each year is quite normal for us,&#8221; WordCamp Croatia co-organizer and Zagreb meetup organizer Emanuel Blagonic said. &#8220;A lot of people from other cities travel to meetups too. Our largest meetup in Zagreb, which usually has 80+ people present and 100+ live stream viewers, usually has people attending from a 300km circle around Zagreb. People also travel to Split when there are meetups there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A renewed <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/07/18/regional-camps-take-2/\" target=\"_blank\">discussion on regional WordCamps</a> is firing up on the WordPress Community team P2 blog, as the topic was discussed at the Community Summit and with recent developments in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-netherlands-reinstated-for-2018\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Netherlands being reinstated</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Asia a possibility for 2019</a>. Croatia is another example of a country where a national WordCamp might benefit the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we started with organizing a WordCamp in Croatia, as a community we hoped that WordCamp will help us boost local communities, thus not having everything centralized in Zagreb (where most other meetups happen, i.e. PHP, Design, UX, JavaScript, Python, etc.),&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;As a community we strongly believe that every region is different and it should be viewed like that. So far we are organizing WordCamps &#8216;no matter what,&#8217; but having a &#8216;national WordCamp would mean more Croatian sponsors and better coverage from national media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Zagreb will be a three-day event, beginning with workshops on the first day as the event has done in previous years. Organizers are planning for 12 workshops in four tracks that will be open to public registration. The main conference will be held Saturday with two tracks. Contributor Day will close out the event on Sunday, followed by a walking tour of the city.</p>\n<p>Friday&#8217;s workshops will be held mostly in Croatian, except a few, such as WordPress Basics and Public Speaking, which will be conducted in English. All of the conference talks this year will be in English.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Croatia is a tourist country and most of the people here speak good English, which is often used at large tech events,&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;With that in mind, every WordCamp so far was (mostly) in English, which means it’s quite welcoming for people outside Croatia, too (Slovenia, Austria, Italy, Germany) – and our community likes to meet new people. Unlike WordCamps, we see Meetups as strong local events so we usually have talks in Croatian there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blagonic said every year so far the WordCamp has had approximately 20% of its attendees traveling from outside Croatia, as the country is relatively small with a population of 4 million. Most attendees travel to the WordCamp from other parts of Croatia.</p>\n<p>Croatia currently has five local meetups, but only the two in Zagreb and Split have enough members to meet regularly. Blagonic said he sees the meetups as a way to help local communities grow and views the WordCamp as &#8220;a celebration of the country community.&#8221; However, he believes centralizing the larger events too much would be detrimental to growing the fledgling WordPress communities in the smaller cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’d say that in Croatia (and in the region) we have a young democracy and we still haven’t found the best way to connect with people,&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;For example, there are four big cities in Croatia where most of the things happen, and the tech scene is quite strong in them. If you go outside of these four hubs, a lot fewer things happen, which is a problem for people living outside. We believe that having a centralized country is bad for growing local communities (outside these areas) so with changing cities each year and with traveling to other Meetups/WordCamps we hope that we will change how people feel about it. &#8220;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:11:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.5.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89500337\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://odd.blog/2017/07/19/wp-super-cache-1-5-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5935:\"<p>WP Super Cache is a fast full-page caching plugin for WordPress.

Simple delivery uses PHP, expert uses mod_rewrite and well, WP-Cache got the boot because it&#8217;s always active anyway.</p>\n<p>WP-Cache caching is always active, but it can be disabled in different ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Disable caching for known users.</li>\n<li> Don&#8217;t cache pages with GET parameters</li>\n<li> Disable caching of feeds</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Headers</h3>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/287\">expanded the number of headers</a> cached by the plugin. The list of headers was borrowed from <a href=\"https://cometcache.com/\">Comet Cache</a>. However, anonymous users will still only see the bare minimum like content-length or content-type. If you need to use security headers like &#8220;X-Frame-Options&#8221; or &#8220;Content-Security-Policy&#8221; you should enable caching of HTTP headers. This unfortunately disables super caching so only WP-Caching is used but it&#8217;s still very fast (and faster in this release than before which I will get to below). You can also use the &#8220;wpsc_known_headers&#8221; filter to modify the list of recognised headers.</p>\n<h3>WP-Cache Reorganisation</h3>\n<p>WP-Cache cache files are split into two files &#8211; one holds the page content, the other (meta file) holds information about the page such as cookies, headers and url. In the past these files were stored in two directories which could become a problem if there were many thousands of those files. Even with only a few hundred files, maintenance could be an issue as deleting related files (like page archives, or copies of the front page) needed every meta file to be inspected.<br />\nNow the files are stored in the supercache directory structure that mirrors your permalink structure. Deleting related files is is simpler and serving files will be faster as the operating system won&#8217;t need to open a directory of thousands of files.<br />\nIf you currently rely on WP-Cache files, the plugin will still look for them where they are, but new WP-Cache files will be created in cache/supercache/example.com/ (where example.com is your hostname).</p>\n<h3>Sitemaps</h3>\n<p>We added support for caching sitemaps, but your sitemap plugin will need to cooperate to get it to work. The sitemap plugin needs to identify the sitemap request as a feed. Jetpack 5.1 now supports this since <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/7397\">#7397</a>. You can disable the caching by excluding feeds from caching.</p>\n<h3>Debugging Improved</h3>\n<p>The debug log is now protected by a username/password. For convenience, the username and password are the same but they are a long md5 string:</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Deleting the log file clears it and resets it ready for more logging. Before, toggling debugging would create a new debug log and the old one would be kept around, but not linked, until deleted by garbage collection, and of course they were text files anyone could access.</p>\n<p>This release includes lots of other small bug fixes and changes. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">number of closed PRs</a> for an exhaustive list of those changes!</p>\n<h3>Testing the REST API</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to send POST requests to a web server but one I like is using curl in a shell script. You&#8217;ll need two bits of information from the website:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> The &#8220;wordpress_logged_in&#8221; cookie from your browser.</li>\n<li> The wp_rest nonce which you can get by adding `echo wp_create_nonce( &#8216;wp_rest&#8217; );` somewhere on your site where you&#8217;re logged in. It&#8217;s good for 24 hours.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My test script looks something like this:<br />\n<code>export NONCE=\'1234567890\'<br />\nexport COOKIE=\'wordpress_logged_in_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=1234567890\'<br />\ncurl -v -X \"GET\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-WP-Nonce: $NONCE\" -H \"Cache-Control: no-cache\" -H \"Cookie: wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check; $COOKIE\" \\<br />\n-d \'{}\' \"https://example.com/wp-json/wp-super-cache/v1/settings/\"</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7\">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9\">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:25:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"HeroPress: Becoming Myself Again\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1978\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=becoming-myself-again\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6018:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/071917-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: The WordPress community is, slowly but surely, helping me get rid of my ingrown fear of the unknown, of others.\" /><p>It’s so easy to become secluded and sit at home, in your own bubble, but it wasn’t until a group of people literally pulled me in with their welcoming atmosphere and demeanor, that I realised that I could function amongst other people as well (even if it was somewhat limited).</p>\n<h3>In The Beginning</h3>\n<p>To understand my bubble, you need to also know a little about me, or rather, about my childhood. I had a less than ideal childhood. I have a great family, lived in a great house, even in the “best country in the world” as they say. And despite this, I say I wasn’t happy with my childhood. My school years were the reason, they were rough. At times I think back and feel like events that unfolded were parts of ridiculous scenes from an over the top movie.</p>\n<p>All in all, the days seemed generic enough, except my school days were a thing of dread. I would suffer physical and verbal abuse throughout my schooldays, even going to and from school, I had no real friends (victim by association is understandably not something a child would want to intentionally walk into. I understand this as an adult, but as a child it’s not that easy).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because of my treatment over the years, I developed trust issues, I got a fear for everyone around me, and it was growing stronger and stronger over the years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I suppressed it, I lied about it, and I got terrifyingly good at the lying part.</p>\n<p>This is why I was drawn to the internet: I didn’t have to interact with people, I didn’t need to go outside where the others were, I could just do my thing and move on. I could live in my own bubble.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>But then the darndest thing happened. I’d been stuck on a project, I needed help, and I turned to a support room for an open source project, for WordPress. If you’ve ever tried to get help in a chat before, you’ll know what kind of an experience it can be, the snarky reactions to your code, the nitpicking of using the wrong terminology, it’s not fun. This place though, they didn’t care that I was not only using the wrong terms, but my entire code was a horrible mess.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where I would usually get the help I needed and move on, popping back in my bubble of solitude, I instead wanted to be like these people, I wanted to use what I learnt to let others get helped.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the years, I all but devote myself to that place. Nobody knew me, I liked staying under the radar, but eventually I got pushed into a team meeting. I was intrigued, so I would watch, I’d say hi, and progressively make my opinions heard. Yet, I would stick to my bubble, once the meeting was over I was back on my own.</p>\n<h3>And Then I Went To WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Until I got to attend my first big WordCamp, the last one held in San Francisco, I was ecstatic! I’d never been to a big conference before, as I didn’t like crowds, but I knew some of the people who would be there. They were people who had been friendly and inviting in the most genuine way imaginable. It’s not easy being worried whenever you’re out amongst people, but this group of people, this community, I didn’t have that fear around them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I somehow made WordCamps my safe space.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They are where I can, if only for a short while, leave that bubble, leave the need to be alone, and be a part of something great! I use them as fuel to get through the hard times, I can look forward to meeting people, people who value my opinions and my experience. People who genuinely want to listen and most of all, care about you! The WordPress community is, slowly but surely, helping me get rid of my ingrown fear of the unknown, of others.</p>\n<p>The community is helping me become myself again.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Becoming Myself Again\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Becoming%20Myself%20Again&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-myself-again%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Becoming Myself Again\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-myself-again%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-myself-again%2F&title=Becoming+Myself+Again\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Becoming Myself Again\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/071917-150x150.jpg&description=Becoming Myself Again\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Becoming Myself Again\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/\" title=\"Becoming Myself Again\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/\">Becoming Myself Again</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:00:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Marius Jensen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Contributors Meeting Provides Opportunities to Ask Questions and Learn the Ropes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73007\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-contributors-meeting-provides-opportunities-to-ask-questions-and-learn-the-ropes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2270:\"<p>Contributing to WordPress or other open source projects can be intimidating for first-time contributors. Sometimes, all you need is a helping hand to overcome fear, intimidation, or other barriers.</p>\n<p>In 2013, with the help of Konstantin Obenland, a WordPress core developer, I overcame my fear and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too\">contributed my first patch</a> to WordPress.</p>\n<p>This is one of the principles behind a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">new weekly meeting</a> that is geared towards new contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new contributors meeting is the perfect place to come if you are new to contributing to WordPress core and have questions,<em>&#8221;

It allows users to roll back any WordPress.org plugin or theme to a previous version with just a few clicks and also <a href=\"https://wordimpress.com/beta-testing-wordpress-plugins-with-wp-rollback/\" target=\"_blank\">supports beta versions of plugins</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why the plugin is so popular. Navigating buggy updates is a natural part of life when maintaining a self-hosted website and not all users have a separate testing environment for their websites. This tool gives them a basic diagnostic tool and the confidence to apply updates knowing they can easily roll it back in case of a problem. Many reviewers cite the plugin as having been &#8220;a lifesaver&#8221; when applying WooCommerce or Yoast SEO updates that had unexpected results.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/apparently-not-working-for-themes-rollback-on-multisites/\" target=\"_blank\">lone one-star review of WP Rollback</a> was given because the user anticipated multisite compatibility and was unable to get it to work. That issue has been solved in the latest update.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordimpress.com/wprollback-wordpress-multisite/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Rollback 1.5</a> is fully compatible with multisite networks, giving super admins the ability to roll back extensions from the network plugin/themes screen or from the the plugins/themes screen of the primary site in the network. Sub-sites do not have the ability to roll back plugins and themes for the entire network. The UI for rolling back themes on the network admin screen is identical to the plugin screens, as multisite doesn&#8217;t have the fancy theme preview screen that single site installs have.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 also adds the ability for users to preview the changelog for previous versions of a plugin. This makes it convenient for users to quickly view the changes for each version without leaving the admin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rollback_changelog.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordimpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">WordImpress</a>, the folks behind WP Rollback, have considered adding core rollbacks and database savepoints, but both features have serious potential drawbacks that could turn it into a high support-demanding plugin. In its current state, the plugin is virtually support-free.</p>\n<p>Matt Cromwell, Head of Support and Community Outreach at WordImpress, said the team thought about monetizing the plugin in the beginning, but is not pursing any plans to do so at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think of it as just one of the many ways we are giving back to the WP community,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Our preference would be for the core team to consider it as a potential feature plugin for eventual core inclusion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cromwell said WordImpress hasn&#8217;t made any intentional steps to see if core folks are interested in WP Rollback becoming a feature plugin, but the team has purposely built it to be as close to core standards as possible.

This should happen shortly and well ahead of August 31st. I&#8217;ll leave the history and philosophy around licensing alone since it&#8217;s generally a complex discussion to have and I&#8217;m not sure that it has actually been fully captured in this thread especially vis a vis Facebook&#8217;s intent.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this morning&#8217;s guidance to PMCs can be adjusted since I don&#8217;t think any of us see a bunch of extra engineering effort as a desirable thing across the ASF projects which are already making use of RocksDB</p></blockquote>\n<p>In light of the ASF Legal Affairs Committee&#8217;s decision to disallow the BSD+Patents License in Apache projects, ASF member Joan Touzet opened an issue on the React repository urging Facebook to consider re-licensing React.js under Apache License v2.0 and GPL 2:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThis has led to a lot of upset and frustration in the Apache community, especially from projects requiring similarly-licensed code as direct dependencies &#8211; the chief of these being RocksDB.</p>\n<p>We (the Apache Software Foundation) have just received word that RocksDB will be re-licensing their code under the dual Apache License v2.0 and GPL 2 licenses.</p>\n<p>As a user of React.JS in an ASF top-level project (Apache CouchDB), please consider re-licensing React.JS under similar terms. Otherwise, many ASF projects such as our own will have to stop relying on and building with React.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although the re-licensing of RocksDB solves that particular project&#8217;s problem, ASF&#8217;s ban of Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license means other widely used technologies from Facebook, including React.js, are still banned. This is likely to cause problems for many open source projects.</p>\n<p>Harshavardhana, from the <a href=\"https://www.minio.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Minio</a> team, commented in support of the petition to Facebook for re-licensing React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our object storage browser UI is based on React and we are Apache 2.0 licensed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would be unfortunate and time consuming to migrate but we will have to do that in lieu of new information regarding Apache incompatibility. Please consider re-licensing React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors to <a href=\"https://github.com/omcljs/om\" target=\"_blank\">Om</a>, a ClojureScript interface for React, are also <a href=\"https://github.com/omcljs/om/issues/882\" target=\"_blank\">discussing whether or not the ASF&#8217;s new requirements will affect their project</a>. Greg Stein, commenting on behalf of ASF, clarified the reasons behind the organization&#8217;s decision to ban Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please note that the ASF chose this path for policy reasons, rather than &#8220;license incompatibility&#8221;. We don&#8217;t want downstream users of Apache code to be surprised by the PATENTS grant that (was) in RocksDB and (is) in React. Users should only need to follow the ALv2, with no further constraints.</p>\n<p>These license can work together (IMO) and simply provide two sets of restrictions upon users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stein said it was not ASF&#8217;s lawyers who made the decision but rather the organization&#8217;s policy decision to &#8220;disallow FB/BSD+Patent license to be mixed into the software the Foundation releases to users.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Facebook is Internally Discussing the Re-Licensing Matter</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315707719\" target=\"_blank\">joined the discussion on GitHub</a> regarding re-licensing with a brief and ambiguous summary about how Facebook is handling the petition to re-license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To give you a small update, there are going to be more internal discussions about this for about a week,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;This is about as much as I can say. I wouldn&#8217;t be too optimistic about this changing for React but we&#8217;ll see. @daveman692 has kindly agreed to provide an update when these discussions are over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dropping the patent grant entirely, which would be the most convenient way of solving this issue for open source projects, isn&#8217;t likely to happen. React has already gone through re-licensing twice during its short history. It was originally licensed under Apache 2.0 but this was changed in October 2014 to the BSD License plus the patent grant, which included a highly controversial termination provision. In April 2015, the patent grant was changed slightly to allow licensees to continue to use the software in the event that a patent lawsuit did not include a counterclaim against Facebook or its affiliates in a matter unrelated to React.js.</p>\n<p>The termination provision in Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents License continues to be unpopular and is regarded suspiciously by many open source project maintainers. When the Drupal project began <a href=\"http://buytaert.net/selecting-a-client-side-framework-for-drupal\" target=\"_blank\">considering a client-side framework to supersede Backbone.js</a>, Dries Buytaert passed on React based on what he said was &#8220;a potentially unacceptable patent clause,&#8221; citing <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650\" target=\"_blank\">pushback from WordPress.com&#8217;s Calypso and React contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>The WordPress open source project has not formally announced its decision on which JavaScript framework will be included in core, but all signs point to React. WordPress&#8217; upcoming Gutenberg editor is built on React and its chief contributors are Automattic employees who work on React-based products for WordPress.com. Gutenberg continues to plough forward at a breakneck pace with no indication of a rewrite, and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg has been outspoken about his preference for using React.</p>\n<p>Although Automattic&#8217;s legal counsel has said the company is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-will-continue-to-use-react-js-in-calypso-despite-patent-clause\" target=\"_blank\">comfortable using React for its product under the project&#8217;s current license </a>, others in the WordPress community are not as amenable to including the framework in core.</p>\n<p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) includes a generic <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent\" target=\"_blank\">BSD+Patent license</a> listed among its approved licenses, but Facebook&#8217;s particular BSD+Patent license has not been submitted. Robert Pierce, a partner at El Camino Legal, <a href=\"https://www.elcaminolegal.com/single-post/2016/10/04/Facebook-Reactjs-License\" target=\"_blank\">contends</a> that the license termination provision ought to be impermissible in an open source license because it exists to protect Facebook from patent litigation that is completely unrelated to React code:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Facebook touts React.js as open source software. But in my mind the license termination provision of the Additional Grant of Patent Rights takes the offering outside the realm of open source software.</p>\n<p>The patent license offered in the Additional Grant of Patent Rights (v.2) is conditioned upon the licensee not bringing a patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook or its affiliates. Thus, the licensee pays a price to use the library. It is not a price paid with money. The price demanded by Facebook for use of the library is that the licensee refrain from exercising any of its patent rights against Facebook or its affiliates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pierce views Facebook&#8217;s publication of React source code as leverage to win some protection against patent lawsuits, which he deems to be &#8220;too greedy an approach for Facebook to claim open source status.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The open source community has widely speculated about the implications of including Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patent license as a dependency, but the license has not yet been tested in court. The Apache Software Foundation is the first major organization to take a hard line stance on the controversial license and this has caught Facebook&#8217;s attention. Facebook representatives have promised an update on the petition for re-licensing after its internal discussions have concluded.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 03:25:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Stylishly Display Weather Conditions with the Weather Atlas Widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73229\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/stylishly-display-weather-conditions-with-the-weather-atlas-widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2207:\"<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to display weather conditions on your site, check out the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/weather-atlas/\">Weather Atlas Widget</a> by <span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"author vcard\"><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/weatheratlas\">Yu Media Group d.o.o</a>.

Over the weekend Ahmad Awais released a new project called <a href=\"https://ahmadawais.com/gutenberg-boilerplate/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Boilerplate For Third-Party Custom Blocks</a>. Awais&#8217; introductory post includes a rundown of his thoughts on the current pros and cons of developing for the Gutenberg project. Although he appreciates the technology behind Gutenberg and the improvements over shortcodes, he is not fully sold on the concept of putting everything into blocks. To learn more, he decided to jump into the code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am still making up my mind with how Gutenberg will fit in the WordPress core,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;There are so many things which are both good and bad about it. So, instead of ranting about it, I wanted to do something more productive. I went ahead, studied the source code and received a lot of help from Gutenberg contributors (Matias Ventura, James Nylen, Riad Benguella, Andrew Duthie, Joen, etc.) to finally build a Gutenberg Boilerplate project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awais&#8217; <a href=\"https://github.com/ahmadawais/Gutenberg-Boilerplate/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Boilerplate</a> is a good starting place for learning more of the basics about developing for the editor. It comes in the form of a plugin that offers four examples of how to build different kinds of custom Gutenberg blocks, with and without a build process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A block with custom CSS for editor and front end</li>\n<li>A block with ES6 or ESNext and a Webpack build process</li>\n<li>A block with editable content</li>\n<li>A block to click Tweet the contents of that block</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, the tweet block, which is something that might previously been handled with a shortcode, is an example that includes four files: block.js to register the custom Gutenberg block, editor.css, style.css, and index.php.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-gb.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Awais noticed that many developers were wanting to try building third-party blocks, but Gutenberg&#8217;s documentation for this was outdated and/or non-existent. He got involved in contributing to the project&#8217;s documentation after discovering the docs describing how to enqueue block and block editor assets were not available. This gave him the inspiration to create a boilerplate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both as a theme/plugin developer, I think there’s going to be a steep learning curve here for just about everyone &#8211; users as well as developers,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;WordPress development just became very complicated with the Gutenberg project. I&#8217;m also not sure how devs will start writing extensions. Some users might expect them to keep the shortcodes for the old editor. Some might ask for blocks in the new one. Is there an API or back-compat? In short everything is changing and this change has both pros and cons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These concerns also tie into the larger discussion around <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952\" target=\"_blank\">how Gutenberg can support legacy metaboxes that use the old PHP framework</a>, instead of updating to the new JS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;New metaboxes should be written in JS, and will appear in the Post Settings sidebar alongside the stock ones,&#8221; Gutenberg contributor Joen Asmussen said. &#8220;Metaboxes written in PHP should ideally be upgraded to be JS, but should continue to work in their PHP form also.&#8221; Asmussen has proposed an &#8220;Extended Settings&#8221; panel to house legacy metaboxes in a section below the editor. It would appear only when legacy plugins and metaboxes are enabled, as shown in the mockup below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/extended-settings-mockup.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Discussion regarding how to support metaboxes is still ongoing. With so many important issues like this up in the air, it&#8217;s too early to know what the future of extending Gutenberg will look like. At the moment, the project is undergoing rapid development and changes, so extending Gutenberg may evolve drastically over a short period of time. If the editor is to preserve the same flexibility and customization opportunities of its predecessor, the project will need to ensure that it is easy to create custom blocks and extensions while continuing to support older PHP metabox infrastructure that is currently widely used.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 20:28:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.5.0 Adds New Verse Block for Poetry and a New Display for Recent Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72830\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-5-0-adds-new-verse-block-for-poetry-and-a-new-display-for-recent-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5718:\"<p>Another round of Gutenberg updates was released today. Last weekend brought <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/08/whats-new-in-gutenberg-july-8th/\" target=\"_blank\">version 0.4.0</a>, which didn&#8217;t have too many noteworthy visible changes on the frontend but introduced an API for handling pasted content. Gutenberg developers are aiming to have specific handling for converting pasted content from applications like Word, Markdown, and Google Docs to native WordPress blocks. Version 0.4.0 also added navigation between blocks using arrow keys and included a new approach for rendering embed frames.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14th-july/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 0.5.0</a> hit dashboards today. One major improvement to the writing flow is that the editor will now avoid showing block UI while the user is typing and/or starting a new paragraph in a text block. You can test this by typing and pressing enter twice to begin a new text block. No UI should be visible during this process. Small improvements like this one are gradually bringing a bit more zen to the editor, which is still full of confusing and surprising experiences.</p>\n<p>Version 0.5.0 adds the ability to upload images via drag-and-drop onto image block placeholders. The example below shows one of my tests. While the image is uploading, it fades in and out. This experience is a bit disconcerting, especially if the upload never resolves. I&#8217;m not certain this UI provides the best communication for the status of the image upload.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version also introduces a new Verse block, which is intended for poetry. It has a slight indent, as compared to a plain text block, but it doesn&#8217;t yet work well with copy and paste. Unless you are a poet composing in WordPress, it&#8217;s far more likely that you will be pasting in poetry content from somewhere else on the web. Other than the initial bugs, it&#8217;s a useful block for those who often post verse.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/verse-block.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the growing number of block types, it can be cumbersome to sort through all of them when adding a new block. Gutenberg 0.5.0 implements a new display for recent blocks. A maximum of eight are shown and the most recently used ones are displayed at the top. It does not yet persist between editor sessions, but Gutenberg contributors plan to add that in the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/recent-blocks.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable improvements in this release include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1833\" target=\"_blank\">New tabs mode for the sidebar</a> to switch between post settings and block inspector</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1816\" target=\"_blank\">Display warning message</a> when navigating away from the editor with unsaved changes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1872\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile implementation</a> of block mover, settings, and delete actions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1852\" target=\"_blank\">Search through all tabs</a> on the inserter and hide tabs</li>\n<li>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1889\" target=\"_blank\">ability to add custom classes</a> to blocks (via inspector)</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1896\" target=\"_blank\">“table of contents” document outline</a> for headings (with empty heading validation)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Writing Long-Form Content with Gutenberg is Still a Frustrating Experience</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg in its current state is a long way away from being an editor that users would embrace for long-form writing. It still contains many unnerving bugs that steal user confidence. For example, when pasting in multiple paragraphs from a lorem ipsum generator, the editor gave me a white screen and I lost all of the content in my post. After a bit of testing I found that pasting in paragraphs one at a time worked.</p>\n<p>This kind of frustrating and unexpected behavior has caused many testers to wonder why it isn&#8217;t being referred to as alpha software instead of beta. WordPress contributor Jon Brown summed up this common sentiment in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/08/whats-new-in-gutenberg-july-8th/#comment-32799\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on the 0.4.0 release post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s getting better, but it honestly still feels more like a 0.0.4 alpha than a 0.4.0 beta,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I’ve tried writing long form content several times with each version since 0.1.0 and each time I’m quickly frustrated by the lack of flow between blocks. It’s more frustrating than TinyMCE.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg needs to make significant progress before it can be suitable for writing anything more than a few short paragraphs. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to get into the flow of creating long-form content with the prominence of the block UI. Right now, the editor just gets in the way. The current UI is skewed heavily towards frequent block creation. It is clutter-some and distracting for pure writing tasks. Following the evolution of the editor, with its fast-paced development cycle, is exhilarating after years of stagnation. But the project is sorely in need of a breakthrough where the Gutenberg UI finally gets out of the way of writing.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 05:14:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Professional Plan Introduces Unlimited Access to 200+ Commercial Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73055\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-professional-plan-introduces-unlimited-access-to-200-commercial-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3407:\"<p>Automattic has been teasing its plan to add commercial themes to Jetpack for several months after introducing theme installation for self-hosted users from WordPress.com. In March, the plugin <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-introduces-theme-installation-from-wordpress-com-sparks-controversy-with-alternative-marketplace-for-free-themes\" target=\"_blank\">opened up access to all of WordPress.com&#8217;s free themes via the Jetpack Manage interface</a>. All signs pointed to Automattic developing the infrastructure to offer commercial themes via Jetpack upgrades. At that time, however, Jetpack team member Richard Muscat said that Automattic had &#8220;no immediate plans to sell themes at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yesterday those subscribed to the Jetpack Announcements email were notified that <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/professional-sites/\" target=\"_blank\">commercial themes have landed</a> in the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/install/professional/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack Professional plan</a>, which is regularly priced at $24.92/month or $299/year. Customers will have unlimited access to more than 200 commercial themes that are already available on WordPress.com. Jetpack users on the free plan will see all the themes available in the WordPress.com theme browser with a prompt to upgrade for the ones that are commercial.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jetpack-themes.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The announcement also noted that any themes users elect to use will be automatically backed up and regularly scanned for malware as part of the security services included in the package. For those who are running a multisite network, each site will need its own Jetpack Professional subscription to have access to the commercial themes.</p>\n<p>For years the WordPress community has speculated about what Automattic&#8217;s long game was for Jetpack, and many believed it was only a matter of time before the plugin started offering commercial upgrades. It was <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2011/03/09/blast-off/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced to the WordPress world in 2011</a>  as a way to provide feature parity between WordPress.com and self-hosted sites. The first version included just eight modules, but fellow plugin developer and entrepreneurs in the community were immediately aware of its commercial potential.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-powers-42-of-all-online-stores\" target=\"_blank\">identified both Jetpack and WooCommerce as “multi-billion dollar opportunities”</a> that could each individually be larger than WordPress.com. The plugin is now active on more than 3 million WordPress sites. Automattic&#8217;s aggressive commercialization of Jetpack in the past two years is the fulfillment of initial predictions about where the plugin was headed.</p>\n<p>The new commercial themes offering significantly raises the value of the Jetpack Professional plan, which was previously targeted at business users who require unlimited storage, Google Analytics, and additional SEO features. With the addition of unlimited use of 200+ themes, Automattic has expanded the Professional plan to be more compelling for non-business users who are simply interested in gaining access to a collection of professionally-supported themes.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 21:46:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.9.0 Release Candidate 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=267012\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/07/buddypress-2-9-0-release-candidate-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2980:\"<p>Today sees BP 2.9.0 move to The final testing phase <strong>Release Candidate 1</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is the last chance to test out this release and report back any issues found before final release in approximately two weeks time.</p>\n<p>Any issues found can be reported to our <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\"> trac ticket home </a>, or raised on the support forum.</p>\n<p>Amongst other improvements and fixes to look out for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing display of older activity comments.</li>\n<li>Correction of message when removing friends that are not friends.</li>\n<li>Group invites &#8211;

Although most violations are unintentional, there are some cases where companies do not comply with the license in order to block competitors from developing similar software.</p>\n<p>GPL enforcement doesn&#8217;t often lead to litigation. When it does, most other avenues of resolving the complaint have already been exhausted. A lawsuit in the air transport industry is currently bringing more attention to the gravity of not complying with open source software licensing requirements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cokinetic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CoKinetic Systems</a>, a developer and manufacturer of in-flight entertainment (IFE) software, has <a href=\"https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/nysd/470007/1-0.html\" target=\"_blank\">filed a case against Panasonic Avionics</a> that includes allegations of a fairly egregious breach of the GPL. The complaint alleges that Panasonic Avionics has monopolized the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market by deliberately refusing to distribute the source code for its open-source Linux-based operating system:</p>\n<blockquote><p>More specifically, Panasonic has built the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software using the open-source Linux kernel, which is clearly governed by the GPL, together with Panasonic’s own modified Linux modules, which are likewise governed by the GPL. </p>\n<p>Indeed, Panasonic has itself affirmatively identified its own modified modules as being subject to the GPL, because the original Linux modules were specifically designed to generate warning messages if other code is linked with or otherwise combined with the Linux modules that are not licensed under the GPL. To suppress these warnings, Panasonic willfully acted to insert code into its own modules to indicate that they were licensed under the GPL.</p>\n<p>Panasonic has incorporated a massive amount of open source modules, programs, and libraries into the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software, without distributing notices or source code to the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software, or even to any part of it&#8230;By deliberately refusing to distribute the source code to the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software in accordance with its GPL obligations, Panasonic intentionally deprives competitors in the market from having the ability to develop software that can access the basic features and capabilities of Panasonic IFE Hardware.</p></blockquote>\n<p>CoKinetic Systems contends that Panasonic&#8217;s refusal to distribute its source code voids its GPL license and &#8220;potentially exposes Panasonic to billions of dollars in statutory damages for hundreds of thousands of hardware installations that willfully infringe copyrights belonging to hundreds or even thousands of software developers that freely contributed source code to Linux.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the complaint details how competitors have to rely on Panasonic&#8217;s APIs in order to offer software services to airlines using Panasonic&#8217;s IFE hardware, because they do not have access to the source code for the Linux-based core software. CoKinetic claims that Panasonic also deliberately blocks competitor products by its selective distribution of its APIs, resulting in stifled industry innovation and monopoly control over the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the worst and most grave allegation in the complaint is that, in addition to locking up the source code and doling out access to the APIs, Panasonic also maliciously sabotaged its own APIs in order to give the appearance that it is the only reliable software service provider for its hardware, which CoKinetic claims is inferior and sold at monopolistic prices.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Panasonic also is able to use its control over the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software in order to make ongoing, undisclosed, and often malicious modifications to its source code, deliberately “breaking” Panasonic’s own APIs in order to purposely and maliciously sabotage the performance of third-party software products that Panasonic deems a competitive threat — particularly CoKinetic software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the introduction to the case, CoKinetic cites a litany of anti-competitive conduct the company has engaged in over the past decade before detailing the current allegations. The case is not purely an open source license dispute, as the plaintiff also alleges that Panasonic abused regulatory processes, engaged in acts of corporate espionage, defamed CoKinetic, paid commercial bribes, and employed unlawful means to monopolize the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market.</p>\n<p>CoKinetic is seeking compensatory damages for Panasonic&#8217;s GPL ongoing GPL breaches. The specific amount would be determined at the trial but the company believes it to be in excess of $100 million. The company also wants the court to compel Panasonic to publicly disclose and distribute the source code.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a case where distributing the source code is just a small sticking point or just a matter of principle. It has the potential to open up the IFE industry for faster progress and greater innovation. Many reading this article have undoubtedly used Panasonic&#8217;s IFE products when flying with the company&#8217;s customers, which include Emirates Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Virgin America, and United Airlines. With the source code available, airline customers could remove Panasonic&#8217;s software from their IFE hardware and replace it with their own software solutions.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/nysd/470007/1-0.html\" target=\"_blank\">complaint</a>, which was filed in the Southern District of New York in March, demands a jury trial. An initial pre-trial conference was held in May, but the case has been slow moving. The Court gave a deadline for the Defendant to file its motion to dismiss, but deadlines have since been extended. The Court also strongly recommended that the two parties retain a private mediator but it&#8217;s not clear how outside mediation could solve such a far-reaching matter that impacts so many vendors. <a href=\"https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/20747763/CoKinetic_Systems,_Corp_v_Panasonic_Avionics_Corporation\" target=\"_blank\">Additional documents</a> are due over the next few months, so it will be some time before there are updates on the progress of the case.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 04:39:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"WPTavern: AJ Morris Acquires iThemes Exchange\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73071\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wptavern.com/aj-morris-acquires-ithemes-exchange\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3545:\"<p>In 2013, iThemes <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ithemes-launches-e-commerce-plugin-exchange\">released Exchange</a>, an e-commerce platform that aimed to make selling online as simple as possible. Today, the company <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/2017/07/13/ithemes-exchange-new-home-exchangewpcom/\">announced</a> that AJ Morris, Product Manager at Liquid Web, has taken over the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When approached about taking over iThemes Exchange early this year, we wanted to be sure the project and our customers went into very competent hands, someone who will love and care for them as much as we do,&#8221; Cory Miller, founder of iThemes, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having spent four and a half years investing in the project and in you and your success, we did not take this lightly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After numerous conversations over the past several months, we believe the best home for Exchange is with ExchangeWP LLC led by AJ Morris.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Everything iThemes Exchange related will transition to <a href=\"https://exchangewp.com/\">ExchangeWP.com</a>. Toolkit, Plugin Suite, Exchange Pro Pack, and iThemes Exchange Add-on customers will be given accounts for free support and upgrades through August 2018 at ExchangeWP.com.</p>\n<p>Beginning today, customers will no longer be able to purchase Exchange or its add-ons through iThemes as the company transfers licenses and products to ExchangeWP. However, iThemes will continue to provide customer support until the transition is completed, expected to happen in early August.</p>\n<p>Morris says he&#8217;ll continue to focus on making e-commerce simple and will provide regular updates to customers to provide insight into what goes into transition a product from one company to another and where the product is heading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These days, it’s very easy to get WordPress up and running so you can start blogging,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;But when you want to add e-commerce to the mix, it&#8217;s a bit different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;With big players like WooCommerce out there, it becomes too much too quickly for the average content producer to get their store up and running.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Exchange is going to continue focusing on the independent publishers that want to keep the revenue they can, while providing a simplistic experience in an easy-to-use e-commerce plugin that will help get their stores online quickly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allowing Morris to take over the project frees up resources for iThemes to focus on three of its flagship products; BackupBuddy, iThemes Security, and iThemes Sync. In addition to their core products, the company says it will soon release a new project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My job as CEO is to be a steward of the time and resources we have at iThemes in order to serve you best,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve realized for a while that it was past time for us to refocus our finite resources on the projects that have the most growth and potential for our company and you.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That meant we either needed to find a new home for Exchange or sunset the project. I’m thankful we didn’t have to do the latter.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ajmorris.me/\">Morris</a> is a <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajmorris\">long-time member</a> of the WordPress community and <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/speakers/aj-morris/\">has spoken</a> at several WordCamps.

This goes beyond the basic <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/publicize/\" target=\"_blank\">Publicize</a> functionality that automatically shares posts to connected accounts as soon as they are published, giving users the ability to automate their content marketing to social networks for the most optimal time for sharing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/schedule-sharing.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to know how a post will appear on social networks once it has automatically been shared, which is one reason why many people choose to manually share a post for the best presentation. You want to ensure that the right thumbnail will show up with a message customized for each network&#8217;s particular audience. The new social scheduling feature on WordPress.com includes a built-in preview screen so users can see what the post will look like once it is shared to the network and then make any necessary tweaks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/social-sharing-previews.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Scheduling social media posts is available on WordPress.com for Premium and Business plan users and for Jetpack Professional and Premium users. On the Premium plan level, which comes in at ~$9/month, users pay less than they would for scheduling apps like Buffer, Hootsuite, or Sprout Social while also getting access to more commercial WordPress features.</p>\n<p>To truly become a realistic replacement for these types of social media marketing apps, WordPress.com would need to offer better analytics tied into the new sharing feature to show how posts are performing at different times and networks. Although WordPress.com allows for unlimited scheduling and users, it would also need to allow sharing to more networks to be more competitive against these apps. For users who don&#8217;t need all of that data but just want the scheduling feature, a paid Jetpack or WordPress.com plan is a more affordable option.</p>\n<p>Several other self-hosted WordPress plugins already <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/schedule+social+media/\" target=\"_blank\">offer scheduling social media posts</a> for free and some even integrate the social accounts with Google Analytics. The addition of this feature to Jetpack commercial plans may not be as compelling for self-hosted users who can already find this for free, but it adds value for existing Jetpack customers who may now be able to replace a plugin or third-party service.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 19:59:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 281 – In Memory of Jesse Petersen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=73045&preview=true&preview_id=73045\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-281-in-memory-of-jesse-petersen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2501:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://www.wpsteward.com/\">Ben Meredith</a>.

It was created to offer a safe place for open source sustainers to collaborate with each other in the open and contributors have already submitted some practical ideas for discussion, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/sustainers/discussions/issues/4\" target=\"_blank\">adding a standardized FUNDING or SUSTAINABILITY file to repositories</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Busy day, got a lot done.

The basic population, as well as technological development, is concentrated in the central part of the country, in &#8220;city-states&#8221;: Moscow and St. Petersburg. Other regions are much less developed: lower wages, worse and more expensive infrastructure, fewer IT-vacancies and activities.</p>\n<p>I was born and grew up in a remote part of Russia &#8211; in the Far East, in one of the industrial cities, which is located in 7 time zones and 9000 kilometers from Moscow. The Internet, like other technologies, reached there with a significant delay and for a lot of money (unlimited Internet at a speed of 64 kb/s appeared only in 2007), Therefore, at first, the basics of site building had to be learned in snatches with the help of dial-up.</p>\n<p>The first site I did in school. It was built using simple HTML and CSS. But even in this form, it was very impressive and exciting. Then such sites were popular and periodically on the Internet I <a href=\"http://softphoenix.narod.ru/about.htm\">met guys</a> of my age who like me comprehended the science of site building.<br />\nI was lucky to find a like-minded person, with whom we were able to develop together for some time and even launch a joint website.<br />\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1963 size-full\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"962\" height=\"637\" /></a></p>\n<h3>University and start of work</h3>\n<p>Admission to the computer faculty of the university allowed to more specifically address the issues of web development: to learn PHP and MySQL, to get acquainted with a couple of CMS and to make <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100207131804/http://www.compnot.ru:80/\">my first blog</a> on WordPress :). As far as I remember, the blog worked on some WordPress assembly using version 2.9. If you count from that moment, it turns out that I somehow have been working with WordPress for almost 8 years.</p>\n<p>In those days, <a href=\"http://ru.wordpress.org\">ru.wordpress.org</a> was just born and there was no main site on the Russian-language Internet. It was a time of amateur assemblies, amateur translations and even <a href=\"http://book.max-3000.com/page/istorija-sozdanija\">alternatives of WordPress</a>, aimed to the Russian segment of the Internet.</p>\n<p>By the will of fate, my first place of work related to website development was the web studio that used Joomla and Drupal. Then there were a few more places of work, during which time WordPress then turned into the main working tool, then returned to the category of extra work and hobbies.</p>\n<p>The turning point was the decision to move to Moscow and a full transition to WordPress in freelance format.</p>\n<h3>Moving to Moscow</h3>\n<p>The scenario of moving to Moscow or St. Petersburg is quite popular among IT specialists of my native region. This is a great chance to find interesting and highly paid job, get acquainted with a lot of IT specialists, including narrow ones, and develop in the area of interest.</p>\n<p>In Moscow, I moved with remote work and I do not have personal experience of employment in this city, but my wife and most of the acquaintances were satisfied with the options found.</p>\n<p>After about six months of living in Moscow, I was even more thirsty for adventure — to become a freelancer and completely concentrate on WordPress. The ability to plan time independently gives additional space for maneuvers and time for reflection. In my case, this led to an increase in activity in the WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>Participate in the WordPress community</h3>\n<p>Actively participate in the life of the community, I started about 1.5 years ago. Initially, these were the replies at the support forum, then the development of my plugins, after which I decided to try myself in translating the extensions into Russian and recording training videos for Russian-speaking users.</p>\n<p>Over time, it turned into a kind of hobby or even a way of life. Every day I read a lot of posts from users on the support forums and try to help resolve their issues, check and correct the added translation lines, periodically record and post training videos.</p>\n<p>Communication with users is very helpful. You are one of the first to learn about the problems and ways to solve them, you can quickly correct some incorrect or incorrect translation. Also, over time, a list of popular questions accumulates, which can be turned into training articles and videos. In turn, the creation of articles and videos helps to structure knowledge and understand the details.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://ru.wordpress.org\">ru.wordpress.org</a> a great team of moderators and translation editors has gathered. We regularly communicate in Slack, some I meet on WordCamp.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1967\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Denis and Sergey\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<p>In November 2016 I took part in the Global Day of Translation 2. It was an unusual experience: broadcasting from around the world, feeling the scale of what was happening and the excitement of the translation. At that time we took 6th place as the most active locale and attracted 7 new translators.</p>\n<h3>Meetups and WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In Russia there are not so many cities where WordPress-meetups are held, and WordCamp is held only in Moscow. But despite all this, these events are a great opportunity to be among WordPress lovers, to see live people with whom I have only spoken on the network before, and just feel the spirit of WordPress :).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1968 size-full\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg\" alt=\"Three big cheery guys at WordCamp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /></a></p>\n<p>This year I plan to visit WordCamp Moscow for the third time. I visit WordCamp as a participant, but I hope someday I will find a topic close to me and I will decide to apply for a presentation :). I think it will be interesting.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>At the moment I&#8217;m a full-time freelancer. This allows me to quite well combine work and activities in the community. I like to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkgL32ycnfl1hs0nJJD6Og\">share knowledge</a> and make WordPress more accessible for Russian users.</p>\n<p>Many resources of WordPress are dominated by English, and some, for example, as <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\">developer.wordpress.org</a> or &#8220;Handbook&#8221; are not available for localization. I hope, in the future this will change and we will be able to expand our activities.</p>\n<p>In any case, WordPress remains the place where you can find yourself and help make life a little better for yourself and the rest of the participants.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"russian\">Как я нашел себя в WordPress</h1>\n<h3>Про Россию и знакомство с технологиями</h3>\n<p>Россия очень большая и очень разная страна. Основное население, как и технологическое развитие, сосредоточено в центральной части страны, в &#8220;городах-государствах&#8221;: Москве и Санкт-Петербурге. Остальные регионы развиты значительно слабее: ниже зарплаты, хуже и дороже инфраструктура, меньшее количество IT-вакансий и мероприятий.</p>\n<p>Я родился и вырос в отдаленной части России — на Дальнем Востоке, в одном из промышленных городов, который расположен в 7 часовых поясах и 9000 километров от Москвы. Интернет, как и другие технологии, доходили туда с существенным опозданием и за большие деньги (безлимитный интернет на скорости 64 кб/сек появился только в 2007 году), поэтому, по началу, азы сайтостроения приходилось познавать урывками с помощью dial-up.</p>\n<p>Первый сайт я сделал ещё в школе. Он был построен на простейшем HTML и CSS. Но даже в таком виде, это было очень впечатляюще и захватывающе. Тогда такие сайты были популярны и, периодически на просторах интернета, я <a href=\"http://softphoenix.narod.ru/about.htm\">встречал ребят</a> моего возраста, которые, как и я, постигали науку сайтостроения.</p>\n<p>Мне повезло найти единомышленника, с которым мы смогли некоторое время вместе развиваться и даже запустить совместный сайт.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1963\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png\" alt=\"Very old style web site.\" width=\"962\" height=\"637\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Университет и начало работы</h3>\n<p>Поступление на компьютерный факультет университета позволило более предметно заняться вопросами веб-разработки: изучить PHP и MySQL, познакомиться с парой CMS и завести <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100207131804/http://www.compnot.ru:80/\">свой первый блог</a> на WordPress :). Насколько я помню, блог работал на какой-то сборке WordPress, использующей версию 2.9. Если вести отсчет с того момента, то получается, что я так или иначе работаю с WordPress уже почти 8 лет.</p>\n<p>В те времена <a href=\"http://ru.wordpress.org/\">ru.wordpress.org</a> только зарождался и в русскоязычном интернете не было какой-то основной площадки. Это было время любительских сборок, любительских переводов и даже <a href=\"http://book.max-3000.com/page/istorija-sozdanija\">альтернатив WordPress</a>, ориентированных на русский сегмент интернета.</p>\n<p>Волею судеб, моим первым местом работы, связанным с разработкой сайтов, стала веб-студия, использовавшая Joomla и Drupal. Затем было ещё несколько мест работы, в течение которых WordPress то превращалась в основной рабочий инструмент, то возвращалась в разряд дополнительной работы и хобби.</p>\n<p>Переломным моментом стало решение о переезде в Москву и полный переход на WordPress в фриланс-формате.</p>\n<h3>Переезд в Москву</h3>\n<p>Сценарий переезда в Москву или Санкт-Петербург достаточно популярен среди IT-специалистов моего родного региона. Это отличный шанс найти интересную и высокооплачиваемую работу, познакомится со множеством IT-специалистов, в том числе узких, и развиться в интересующей области.</p>\n<p>В Москву я переезжал вместе с удаленной работой и у меня нет личного опыта трудоустройства в этом городе, но моя жена и большинство знакомых остались довольны найденными вариантами.</p>\n<p>Примерно через полгода проживания в Москве, меня обуздала ещё большая жажда приключений — стать фрилансером и полностью сосредоточиться на WordPress. Возможность самостоятельно планировать время дает дополнительное пространство для маневров и время на размышления. В моем случае, это привело к увеличению активности в сообществе WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Участие в сообществе WordPress</h3>\n<p>Активно участвовать в жизни сообщества я начал примерно 1.5 года назад. Вначале это были ответы на форуме поддержки, затем разработка своих плагинов, после чего я решил попробовать себя в переводе расширений на русский язык и записи обучающих видео для русскоязычных пользователей.</p>\n<p>Со временем это превратилось в некое хобби или даже образ жизни. Каждый день я читаю множество сообщений от пользователей на форумах поддержки и пытаюсь помочь решить их вопросы, проверяю и корректирую добавленные строки перевода, периодически записываю и выкладываю обучающие ролики.</p>\n<p>Общение с пользователями очень помогает. Ты одним из первых узнаешь о проблемах и способах их решения, можешь оперативно исправить какой-то неверный или некорректный перевод. Также, со временем накапливается список популярных вопросов, которые можно превращать в обучающие статьи и ролики. В свою очередь, создание статей и видео помогает структурировать знания и разобраться в деталях.</p>\n<p>На <a href=\"http://ru.wordpress.org/\">ru.wordpress.org</a> собралась отличная команда модераторов и редакторов переводов. Мы регулярно общаемся в Slack, некоторых я встречаю на WordCamp.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1967\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Denis and Sergey\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<p>В ноябре 2016 я принимал участвовали в Глобальном дне перевода 2. Это был необычный опыт: трансляции со всего света, ощущение масштабности происходящего и азарта перевода. В тот раз мы заняли 6 место как самый активный язык и привлекли 7 новых переводчиков.</p>\n<h3>Митапы и WordCamp</h3>\n<p>В России не так много городов, где проводятся WordPress-митапы, а WordCamp проводится только в Москве. Но не смотря на всё это, данные мероприятия — отличная возможность побыть среди любителей WordPress, увидеть в живую людей, с которыми до этого общался только по сети, и просто почувствовать дух WordPress :).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1968\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /></a></p>\n<p>В этом году я планирую посетить WordCamp Moscow в третий раз. Я посещаю WordCamp как участник, но надеюсь когда-нибудь найду близкую мне тему и решусь подать заявку на выступление :). Я думаю, это будет интересно.</p>\n<h3>Заключение</h3>\n<p>На данный момент я — фул-тайм фрилансер. Это позволяет мне достаточно неплохо совмещать работу и деятельность в сообществе. Мне нравится <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkgL32ycnfl1hs0nJJD6Og\">делиться знаниями</a> и делать WordPress доступнее для русскоязычных пользователей</p>\n<p>На многих ресурсах WordPress преобладает английский язык, а некоторые, например, как <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\">developer.wordpress.org/</a> или &#8220;Handbook&#8221; вовсе недоступны для локализации. Надеюсь, в будущем это изменится и мы сможем расширить свою деятельность.</p>\n<p>В любом случае, WordPress остается тем местом, где можно найти себя и помочь сделать его чуточку лучше для себя и остальных участников.</p>\n<h2>участник</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1961\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/photo-min-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Denis Yanchevskiy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Денис Янчевский</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://denisco.pro/\">http://denisco.pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/dyanchevskiy\">@dyanchevskiy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/speakers/denisco/\">WordPress.tv</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/denisco/\">WordPress.org Profile</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: How I found myself in WordPress &#8211;

WordPress.com users are encouraged to send a message to the FCC and also enable the Fight for Net Neutrality Plugin via the dashboard Settings screen.</p>\n<p>The plugin is open source and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/net-neutrality/\" target=\"_blank\">available to self-hosted users on WordPress.org</a>. Unlike the existing plugins that support the event on July 12 by presenting visitors with a banner to raise awareness, Automattic&#8217;s plugin simulates what life might be like in the &#8220;slow lane&#8221; if the FCC abandons the principle of net neutrality. It replaces a few of the posts on your site with a “Still Loading” spinner. This plugin doesn&#8217;t seem to offer a way to test it ahead of the event, but it essentially displays a message at the bottom of your website and slows down some of your posts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/net-neutrality-plugin.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin will automatically be disabled after the event has concluded, so both WordPress.com and self-hosted users do not have to worry about turning it off and can remove it later.

It includes a number of improvements, most notably, the ability to load plugin definitions from a user-defined location within the wp-content directory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/aba96d3f63bc5d84d49019bffa47252f87734288/docs/Plugin-Support.md\">Plugin definitions</a> are files used to understand data, actions, shortcodes, and other things plugins do in order to automatically provide version control for them.</p>\n<p>According to Borek Bernard, co-founder of VersionPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you create a folder WP_CONTENT_DIR/.versionpress/plugins/woocommerce and put <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/aba96d3f63bc5d84d49019bffa47252f87734288/docs/Plugin-Support.md\">definition files</a> like schema.yml or actions.yml there, VersionPress will use and actually prefer it over the bundled definitions if they exist.</p></blockquote>\n<img />User Defined Location of Plugin Definition File\n<p>Support for WooCommerce and Jetpack are included in 4.0 Beta 1. VersionPress will automatically detect the definition file as long as each plugin has a .versionpress folder in it.</p>\n<p>With the release of 4.0 Beta, Bernard says a <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/1243\">repository</a> containing plugin definitions is next on the list and is encouraging plugin authors to contribute to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The final step is to have an online repository of the definitions,&#8221; Bernard said. &#8220;It will be open to anyone to contribute, not just plugin authors, and used by VersionPress transparently.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For insight on how to create definitions, developers can look at <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/tree/aba96d3f63bc5d84d49019bffa47252f87734288/plugins/versionpress/.versionpress\">WordPress core</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pavelevap/versionpress-for-woocommerce\">WooCommerce</a> for real-world examples.</p>\n<p>Other major changes include full support for WordPress 4.7 and 4.8, adoption of <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/projects/2\">GitHub projects</a> to help manage the development process, and <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues?q=project%3Aversionpress%2Fversionpress%2F2+sort%3Acreated-desc+label%3Abug\">a number of bugs fixed</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers and users can download <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/releases/tag/4.0-beta\">4.0 Beta</a> from GitHub. Users are encouraged to test the plugin in a staging environment as it&#8217;s not ready to be used on live sites.

Lift founders Chris Wallace and Brad Miller will join 10up&#8217;s 120+ person distributed team, along with Lift&#8217;s director of technology, Christian Chung, and front-end developer Anthony Garand.</p>\n<p>10up is acquiring the Lift UX brand, hiring four team members, and will also take possession of <a href=\"https://remotejobs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RemoteJobs.com</a>, which will continue operating independently as a remote job board. The Lift UX brand will be dissolved and clients and projects are in the process of transitioning over to 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were always looking for agencies to partner with and when I reached out to 10up I was looking to build a relationship to help work on UX design projects,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;10up has a strong engineering background and I felt like having them as a partner would be huge for our agency. Jake and I quickly realized that Lift UX and 10up had so many similar processes that it sounded like our two companies were the same but just different in size.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With similar expertise serving large clients in the WordPress space, the two companies were bound to end up competing on different projects, which happened during the course of their conversations spanning a year leading up to the deal. Miller said 10up founder Jake Goldman proposed a merger/acquisition type of approach.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I ended up speaking to them off and on for the next couple of weeks and things got pretty serious when we were competing for some projects,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;I was of course flattered by the offer. Jake and John were awesome. We enjoyed our conversations and decided to do an onsite to discuss things in more detail. They made an offer after our onsite and Chris and I decided to accept it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 10up&#8217;s announcement, Goldman said it &#8220;takes a special kind of chemistry and alignment for a deal like this to work.&#8221; The company&#8217;s acquisition of Lift is one of the biggest design-driven acquisitions in the WordPress ecosystem in awhile.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adding more experience design expertise to our company DNA enhances our empathy and ability to collaborate with design partners in an era of interactive, responsive design where divisions between &#8216;design&#8217; and &#8216;engineering&#8217; have eroded,&#8221; Goldman said.</p>\n<p>Miller, who has worked with Wallace to build Lift into a top-notch design and user experience agency, said that securing design talent is a challenge in the industry. 10up adding a fellow competitor to its team is a stretegic move when design talent is in short supply.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s certainly hard to find quality talent that&#8217;s interested in a full time position,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;There are some amazing designers out there but a lot of them are contractors/freelancers. 10up wanted to find a team that had a big focus on quality design and UX. It didn&#8217;t hurt that we were big on WordPress either.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miller and Wallace founded Lift UX in 2009 and will be closing out a chapter of their entrepreneurial lives as the brand dissolves into 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically we&#8217;ll fade into the 10up brand bringing along our team, portfolio, accolades, and ultimately our personality,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>Wallace said closing out this chapter is &#8220;definitely bittersweet,&#8221; but the team is excited to transition into 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a 6-7 person agency, we were all constantly being pulled in a million different directions,&#8221; Wallace said. &#8220;Joining 10up allows us to focus on our individual areas of specialization and excel in each. I love many aspects of entrepreneurship and small agency ownership but the idea of focusing on the success of the experience design team at 10up is something I am looking forward to.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:02:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Donncha: Thank you Translators!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89500320\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://odd.blog/2017/07/11/thank-you-translators/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1384:\"<p>Well, well. <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-super-cache\">WP Super Cache translations</a> are coming along well. 100% of strings in the development version are translated into Canadian English and Romanian!

We&#8217;re still shipping translation files but I think the release after that may ship without and rely entirely on the up-to-date online translations.</p>\n<p>So, thank you so much to the translators. Code is nigh on useless if the user and developer don&#8217;t speak the same language and the interface is incomprehensible.

The right size is probably somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500. The venue can do more than that, but I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s the main goal. Bigger isn&#x27;t always better. Your main goal is the best event and quality for the people who are already there.\"</p>\n<p>Meza said he considers WordCamp US to be the premier event for North America and that it is there to represent the communities located in this area.

The way we use different colors has a dramatic impact on how we subconsciously relate to objects.  Our Sector 51 Pathshala received a new avatar from Ms. Shikha , Ms. Reena and the volunteers of the team \"Udaan Ek Metha Sapna\" where graffiti were painted on all the walls of the pathshala. The walls were decorated with the pictures of animals portraying different stories and with kids holding out numbers and alphabets. Even the outer walls of the garden were painted with the figures of education. The walls typically spoke of allegories through images. Colors in kids\' surroundings help boost activity, orange has shown to increase performance, yellow increases emotion of joy, blue helps create a state of relaxation and calmness.

And taking mind in that we do have lots of activities and check-ups of the children\'s .\r\n\r\nFollowing are some steps in the Health section is :-\r\n\r\n1) <b> EYE CHECK-UPS:-</b> Freepathshala has done eye check up for the children after every four months with proper machinery and medicines from the eye specialized doctor.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nTo start off the month of October\'16 our team in association with <strong>The team of Eye Q vision organised a eye checkup camp</strong>. Regardless of age or physical health, it is important for everyone to have regular eye examinations. Regular tests are one of the best ways to protect vision because it can detect eye problems at their earliest stage, when they’re most treatable. Our kids are generally not able to afford such regular checkups and thus a lot of genetic diseases remain undetected which could otherwise be treated easily.\r\n\r\nThere were <strong>78 families</strong> and <strong>40 kids</strong> who were examined. Prescriptions were provided and the kids were advised to eat of lot of green vegetables to keep their eye health under check. According to the <strong>World Health Organisation</strong>, a massive <strong>80%</strong> of all blindness is preventable and having a simple eye test on a regular basis really does make all the difference. By looking into the eyes, optician may be able to see blood vessel leaks or swelling macular which are early signs of diabetes. Similarly, they may be able to detect the early stages of glaucoma or cataracts. Such facts lead to the necessity of providing our kids with periodic checkups to prevent further complications and thus are absolutely essential.\r\n<div><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-671\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG-20170629-WA0004.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"516\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14441085_1186200824773986_2319920063021912168_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n2) <b> YOGA:- </b> Regular exercise and morning exercise with the yoga instructor to maintain harmony and peace in the mind plus make them physically strong.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14639628_1223130211081047_1549998528076974194_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n3)<b>Good Touch and Bad Touch:-</b> In today’s times, we hear a lot about child abuse and molestation. Each one of us want our children to be safe and secure and to protect them against all odds that come their way. As kids grow up, they start meeting new people they don\'t know and fall prey to immoral minds. Most of the time, targets are very young children, below 6-7 years of age. They are too young to understand the difference between right and wrong. It’s high time, we start teaching young children about “Good Touch Bad Touch” to help prevent more damage. In association with the team of Hope Initiative, we decided to expound our kids about this topic. The kids were taught how to know if some person can cause them harm or already mistreats them and the measures that they could take in case they though that the person can cause them harm. Since their parents leave the house early in the morning to reach the construction site, there are many times the kids are left alone at home. Which is the time when we think the kids are the most susceptible to damage. This becomes our responsibility to equip and sensitise them to face any situation or person before the harm is done. We must all try to ensure that every kid becomes physically and emotionally strong to face every situation that must come their way.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16266221_1302941039766630_7458161962520732968_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n3)<strong>Meal Distribution Drive</strong><b>:- </b>With the group of Aaokhilayen Gurgaon team, we organise nutritious meals for the kids every Saturday. The meal include fruits ,like bananas ,and milk. A sumptuous repast is quiet essential in the early stages of childhood to check on the overall development of the kids. Malnutrition rates for India are extremely high, with about 38.4 per cent of children being stunted and 46 per cent underweight (National Family Health Survey, 2005-06). Calcium through milk helps in the proper development of bones in the adolescent ages. We as a country have been successful in reducing the child mortality rates to a large extent and the challenge that arises next is to provide nutrition for their growth and their long-term well being. Fruits are quiet important to provide essential vitamins and minerals and this every weekend activity of ours becomes even more crucial since the construction workers cannot afford such wholesome meals for their kids.<b>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-679\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG-20170704-WA0002.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\"

Investigating designs is usually a detailed research performed which includes collecting data, the path to be followed and then analyzing the gathered information using designs and architectures. The students were required to build a roadmap that they follow to reach the pathshala each morning from their respective houses. The goal of the activity was to drive the already available knowledge to the kids to make substantial conclusions whenever required, to push their minds to ponder over other ways to solve a problem. The roadmap would help the kids think of other possible ways of reaching the pathshala if any one of the route is blocked due to some reason. It may also help them guide people to either the pathshala or their houses. If a situation arises that the kid is lost in the city, the design would help him identify the possible routes to reach his destination. The activity was performed in the month of march in HUDA park. The students counted trees in the region by drawing circles and also drafted a pathway from the park with the elements that they usually spot on the way. The task is our step to provide the kids with an out of the box thinking capability and for the comprehensive development of the kids.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-660\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17361630_1649160552045760_7311229945647874152_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" /> <img class=\" wp-image-661 alignnone\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17362431_1649160612045754_5807452170966717960_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Robotics:</strong> Makers Workshop by Mr. Harkrishan Singh and his team was organised for our kids at our Sector 51 pathshala. This workshop goal was to espouse the popular maker movement. Maker culture is a movement that embraces do-it-yourself tinkering with electronics and physical objects, it focuses on learning and trying out new practical skills, building a community of resources and experimenting. Through this kids start to understand how simple machines work and it also imparts them with problem solving skills and creativity. In our workshop kids were taught to make their own ARTBOTS that could draw for them. They made the BOTS with all that was available to them and some other electronic devices. Creativity flowed as we saw extensive varieties of BOTS. Kids started having so much fun that they did not realise how much they were learning through it. Instead of something static, you can get the pieces moving and that makes the activity way more amusing. Children were also taught about the basic electronic parts and how to set them up. Kids who learn how to plan and build structures and projects when they’re young can continue to apply these concepts as they’re exposed to more complex ideas. Credits to Mr. Ashish Sharma for the pictures and videos and to Ms. Meghna Bhutoria for connecting. At the end of the session all of the kids posed with their BOTS with pride.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-658\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"884\" height=\"662\" />\r\n<pre class=\"aLF-aPX-K0-aPE aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR\"></pre>','Up-Skilling','This is the excerpt for a featured post.','publish','open','open','','featured-content','','','2017-06-28 15:06:35','2017-06-28 15:06:35','',0,'https://vikas111blog.wordpress.com/?p=8',0,'post','',0),(156,1,'2017-05-24 13:28:31','2017-05-24 13:28:31',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','156','','','2017-06-07 12:42:49','2017-06-07 12:42:49','',0,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/05/24/',2,'nav_menu_item','',0),(233,1,'2017-05-25 13:13:17','2017-05-25 13:13:17','<h4>Roshan Kumar Rawat</h4>\r\nMBA HR, MSW\r\n15yr Corporate Exposure as HR Professional.\r\nBuilding opportunities to educate construction workers kids.\r\n<h4>Shalini Bandooni</h4>\r\nB.Sc Gold Medallist, B.ed 2005, Ex Teacher Govt College\r\nShe advise us on Academics\r\n<h4>Tanishk Bhardwaj</h4>\r\nSecurities Compliance | 100 Young Social Entrepreneurs of Color | Asian High Potential Young Leaders Invitee.\r\nHe advise us on Funding, Social Media and People Operations.\r\n<h4>Dr. Shesadev Nayak</h4>\r\nProfessor-School of Management, O P Jindal University.

And taking mind in that we do have lots of activities and check-ups of the children\'s .\r\n\r\nFollowing are some steps in the Health section is :-\r\n\r\n1) <b> EYE CHECK-UPS:-</b> Freepathshala has done eye check up for the children after every four months with proper machinery and medicines from the eye specialized doctor.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nTo start off the month of October\'16 our team in association with <strong>The team of Eye Q vision organised a eye checkup camp</strong>. Regardless of age or physical health, it is important for everyone to have regular eye examinations. Regular tests are one of the best ways to protect vision because it can detect eye problems at their earliest stage, when they’re most treatable. Our kids are generally not able to afford such regular checkups and thus a lot of genetic diseases remain undetected which could otherwise be treated easily.\r\n\r\nThere were <strong>78 families</strong> and <strong>40 kids</strong> who were examined. Prescriptions were provided and the kids were advised to eat of lot of green vegetables to keep their eye health under check. According to the <strong>World Health Organisation</strong>, a massive <strong>80%</strong> of all blindness is preventable and having a simple eye test on a regular basis really does make all the difference. By looking into the eyes, optician may be able to see blood vessel leaks or swelling macular which are early signs of diabetes. Similarly, they may be able to detect the early stages of glaucoma or cataracts. Such facts lead to the necessity of providing our kids with periodic checkups to prevent further complications and thus are absolutely essential.\r\n<div><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-671\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG-20170629-WA0004.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"516\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14441085_1186200824773986_2319920063021912168_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n2) <b> YOGA:- </b> Regular exercise and morning exercise with the yoga instructor to maintain harmony and peace in the mind plus make them physically strong.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14639628_1223130211081047_1549998528076974194_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n3)<b>Good Touch and Bad Touch:-</b> In today’s times, we hear a lot about child abuse and molestation. Each one of us want our children to be safe and secure and to protect them against all odds that come their way. As kids grow up, they start meeting new people they don\'t know and fall prey to immoral minds. Most of the time, targets are very young children, below 6-7 years of age. They are too young to understand the difference between right and wrong. It’s high time, we start teaching young children about “Good Touch Bad Touch” to help prevent more damage. In association with the team of Hope Initiative, we decided to expound our kids about this topic. The kids were taught how to know if some person can cause them harm or already mistreats them and the measures that they could take in case they though that the person can cause them harm. Since their parents leave the house early in the morning to reach the construction site, there are many times the kids are left alone at home. Which is the time when we think the kids are the most susceptible to damage. This becomes our responsibility to equip and sensitise them to face any situation or person before the harm is done. We must all try to ensure that every kid becomes physically and emotionally strong to face every situation that must come their way.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16266221_1302941039766630_7458161962520732968_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n3)<strong>Meal Distribution Drive</strong><b>:- </b>With the group of Aaokhilayen Gurgaon team, we organise nutritious meals for the kids every Saturday. The meal include fruits ,like bananas ,and milk. A sumptuous repast is quiet essential in the early stages of childhood to check on the overall development of the kids. Malnutrition rates for India are extremely high, with about 38.4 per cent of children being stunted and 46 per cent underweight (National Family Health Survey, 2005-06). Calcium through milk helps in the proper development of bones in the adolescent ages. We as a country have been successful in reducing the child mortality rates to a large extent and the challenge that arises next is to provide nutrition for their growth and their long-term well being. Fruits are quiet important to provide essential vitamins and minerals and this every weekend activity of ours becomes even more crucial since the construction workers cannot afford such wholesome meals for their kids.<b>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-679\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG-20170704-WA0002.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" />\r\n</b>','Health','This is the excerpt for your very first post.','inherit','closed','closed','','5-revision-v1','','','2017-07-04 09:22:31','2017-07-04 09:22:31','',5,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/07/5-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(292,1,'2017-05-25 16:46:58','2017-05-25 16:46:58','','cropped-14720624_1198905393503529_3894933365093853169_n.jpg','','inherit','open','closed','','cropped-14720624_1198905393503529_3894933365093853169_n-jpg','','','2017-06-07 12:38:51','2017-06-07 12:38:51','',150,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-14720624_1198905393503529_3894933365093853169_n.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(177,1,'2017-05-24 14:08:36','2017-05-24 14:08:36',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','177','','','2017-05-27 21:34:40','2017-05-27 21:34:40','',145,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/05/24/177/',6,'nav_menu_item','',0),(178,1,'2017-05-24 14:08:36','2017-05-24 14:08:36','<h4>Roshan Kumar Rawat</h4>\r\nMBA HR, MSW\r\n15yr Corporate Exposure as HR Professional. \r\nBuilding opportunities to educate construction workers kids.\r\n\r\n<h4>Shalini Bandooni</h4>\r\nB.Sc Gold Medallist, B.ed 2005, Ex Teacher Govt College\r\nShe advise us on Academics\r\n\r\n<h4>Tanishk Bhardwaj</h4>\r\nSecurities Compliance | 100 Young Social Entrepreneurs of Color | Asian High Potential Young Leaders Invitee. \r\nHe advise us on Funding, Social Media and People Operations.\r\n\r\n<h4>Dr. Shesadev Nayak</h4>\r\nProfessor-School of Management, O P Jindal University.

Investigating designs is usually a detailed research performed which includes collecting data, the path to be followed and then analyzing the gathered information using designs and architectures. The students were required to build a roadmap that they follow to reach the pathshala each morning from their respective houses. The goal of the activity was to drive the already available knowledge to the kids to make substantial conclusions whenever required, to push their minds to ponder over other ways to solve a problem. The roadmap would help the kids think of other possible ways of reaching the pathshala if any one of the route is blocked due to some reason. It may also help them guide people to either the pathshala or their houses. If a situation arises that the kid is lost in the city, the design would help him identify the possible routes to reach his destination. The activity was performed in the month of march in HUDA park. The students counted trees in the region by drawing circles and also drafted a pathway from the park with the elements that they usually spot on the way. The task is our step to provide the kids with an out of the box thinking capability and for the comprehensive development of the kids.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-658\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"884\" height=\"662\" />','Up-Skilling','This is the excerpt for a featured post.','inherit','closed','closed','','154-revision-v1','','','2017-06-27 14:43:24','2017-06-27 14:43:24','',154,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/06/154-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(252,1,'2017-05-25 13:54:09','2017-05-25 13:54:09','','child','','inherit','open','closed','','child','','','2017-05-25 13:54:09','2017-05-25 13:54:09','',150,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/child.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(616,1,'2017-06-07 13:33:06','2017-06-07 13:33:06','','Screenshot (151)','','inherit','open','closed','','screenshot-151','','','2017-06-07 13:33:06','2017-06-07 13:33:06','',0,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-151.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(254,1,'2017-05-25 13:55:15','2017-05-25 13:55:15',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','254','','','2017-06-07 12:42:49','2017-06-07 12:42:49','',39,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/05/254/',12,'nav_menu_item','',0),(255,1,'2017-05-25 13:55:15','2017-05-25 13:55:15',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','255','','','2017-06-07 12:42:49','2017-06-07 12:42:49','',39,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/05/255/',13,'nav_menu_item','',0),(256,1,'2017-05-25 13:57:05','2017-05-25 13:57:05','<h4>Roshan Kumar Rawat</h4>\r\nMBA HR, MSW\r\n15yr Corporate Exposure as HR Professional.\r\nBuilding opportunities to educate construction workers kids.\r\n<h4>Shalini Bandooni<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-236\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Shalini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"121\" height=\"121\" />ddbgser</h4>\r\nB.Sc Gold Medallist, B.ed 2005, Ex Teacher Govt College\r\nShe advise us on Academics\r\n<h4>Tanishk Bhardwaj</h4>\r\nSecurities Compliance | 100 Young Social Entrepreneurs of Color | Asian High Potential Young Leaders Invitee.\r\nHe advise us on Funding, Social Media and People Operations.\r\n<h4>Dr. Shesadev Nayak</h4>\r\nProfessor-School of Management, O P Jindal University.

Investigating designs is usually a detailed research performed which includes collecting data, the path to be followed and then analyzing the gathered information using designs and architectures. The students were required to build a roadmap that they follow to reach the pathshala each morning from their respective houses. The goal of the activity was to drive the already available knowledge to the kids to make substantial conclusions whenever required, to push their minds to ponder over other ways to solve a problem. The roadmap would help the kids think of other possible ways of reaching the pathshala if any one of the route is blocked due to some reason. It may also help them guide people to either the pathshala or their houses. If a situation arises that the kid is lost in the city, the design would help him identify the possible routes to reach his destination. The activity was performed in the month of march in HUDA park. The students counted trees in the region by drawing circles and also drafted a pathway from the park with the elements that they usually spot on the way. The task is our step to provide the kids with an out of the box thinking capability and for the comprehensive development of the kids.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-660\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17361630_1649160552045760_7311229945647874152_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" /> <img class=\" wp-image-661 alignnone\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17362431_1649160612045754_5807452170966717960_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" />\n\n<strong>3) Robotics:</strong> Makers Workshop by Mr. Harkrishan Singh and his team was organised for our kids at our Sector 51 pathshala. This workshop goal was to espouse the popular maker movement. Maker culture is a movement that embraces do-it-yourself tinkering with electronics and physical objects, it focuses on learning and trying out new practical skills, building a community of resources and experimenting. Through this kids start to understand how simple machines work and it also imparts them with problem solving skills and creativity. In our workshop kids were taught to make their own ARTBOTS that could draw for them. They made the BOTS with all that was available to them and some other electronic devices. Creativity flowed as we saw extensive varieties of BOTS. Kids started having so much fun that they did not realise how much they were learning through it. Instead of something static, you can get the pieces moving and that makes the activity way more amusing. Children were also taught about the basic electronic parts and how to set them up. Kids who learn how to plan and build structures and projects when they’re young can continue to apply these concepts as they’re exposed to more complex ideas. Credits to Mr. Ashish Sharma for the pictures and videos and to Ms. Meghna Bhutoria for connecting. At the end of the session all of the kids posed with their BOTS with pride.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-658\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"884\" height=\"662\" />\n<pre class=\"aLF-aPX-K0-aPE aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR\"></pre>','Up-Skilling','This is the excerpt for a featured post.','inherit','closed','closed','','154-autosave-v1','','','2017-06-28 15:06:03','2017-06-28 15:06:03','',154,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/05/154-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(269,1,'2017-05-25 14:20:44','2017-05-25 14:20:44','','Home','This is the home page\'s excerpt','inherit','closed','closed','','150-revision-v1','','','2017-05-25 14:20:44','2017-05-25 14:20:44','',150,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/05/150-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(260,1,'2017-05-25 14:13:08','2017-05-25 14:13:08','<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-252\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/child.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"991\" height=\"676\" />Welcome to your new site!

And taking mind in that we do have lots of activities and check-ups of the children\'s .\r\n\r\nFollowing are some steps in the Health section is :-\r\n\r\n1) <b> EYE CHECK-UPS:-</b> Freepathshala has done eye check up for the children after every four months with proper machinery and medicines from the eye specialized doctor.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nTo start off the month of October\'16 our team in association with <strong>The team of Eye Q vision organised a eye checkup camp</strong>. Regardless of age or physical health, it is important for everyone to have regular eye examinations. Regular tests are one of the best ways to protect vision because it can detect eye problems at their earliest stage, when they’re most treatable. Our kids are generally not able to afford such regular checkups and thus a lot of genetic diseases remain undetected which could otherwise be treated easily.\r\n\r\nThere were <strong>78 families</strong> and <strong>40 kids</strong> who were examined. Prescriptions were provided and the kids were advised to eat of lot of green vegetables to keep their eye health under check. According to the <strong>World Health Organisation</strong>, a massive <strong>80%</strong> of all blindness is preventable and having a simple eye test on a regular basis really does make all the difference. By looking into the eyes, optician may be able to see blood vessel leaks or swelling macular which are early signs of diabetes. Similarly, they may be able to detect the early stages of glaucoma or cataracts. Such facts lead to the necessity of providing our kids with periodic checkups to prevent further complications and thus are absolutely essential.\r\n<div><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-671\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG-20170629-WA0004.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"516\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14441085_1186200824773986_2319920063021912168_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n2) <b> YOGA:- </b> Regular exercise and morning exercise with the yoga instructor to maintain harmony and peace in the mind plus make them physically strong.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14639628_1223130211081047_1549998528076974194_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n3)<b>Good Touch and Bad Touch:-</b> In today’s times, we hear a lot about child abuse and molestation. Each one of us want our children to be safe and secure and to protect them against all odds that come their way. As kids grow up, they start meeting new people they don\'t know and fall prey to immoral minds. Most of the time, targets are very young children, below 6-7 years of age. They are too young to understand the difference between right and wrong. It’s high time, we start teaching young children about “Good Touch Bad Touch” to help prevent more damage. In association with the team of Hope Initiative, we decided to expound our kids about this topic. The kids were taught how to know if some person can cause them harm or already mistreats them and the measures that they could take in case they though that the person can cause them harm. Since their parents leave the house early in the morning to reach the construction site, there are many times the kids are left alone at home. Which is the time when we think the kids are the most susceptible to damage. This becomes our responsibility to equip and sensitise them to face any situation or person before the harm is done. We must all try to ensure that every kid becomes physically and emotionally strong to face every situation that must come their way.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16266221_1302941039766630_7458161962520732968_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />','Health','This is the excerpt for your very first post.','inherit','closed','closed','','5-revision-v1','','','2017-07-04 09:09:14','2017-07-04 09:09:14','',5,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/07/5-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(263,1,'2017-05-25 14:18:29','2017-05-25 14:18:29','','cropped-children1-1.jpg','','inherit','open','closed','','cropped-children1-1-jpg','','','2017-05-25 14:18:29','2017-05-25 14:18:29','',0,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-children1-1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(266,1,'2017-05-25 14:19:12','2017-05-25 14:19:12','http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-photo.jpg','cropped-photo.jpg','','inherit','open','closed','','cropped-photo-jpg','','','2017-05-25 14:19:12','2017-05-25 14:19:12','',0,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-photo.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(267,1,'2017-05-25 14:19:57','2017-05-25 14:19:57','http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-photo-1.jpg','cropped-photo-1.jpg','','inherit','open','closed','','cropped-photo-1-jpg','','','2017-05-25 14:19:57','2017-05-25 14:19:57','',0,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-photo-1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(667,1,'2017-06-28 15:06:35','2017-06-28 15:06:35','Freepathshala provide various programs which will improve the children\'s physical as well as mental skills.Over all personality development is important for the children\'s to cope with the mainstream race of the real world.\r\nThese type of activities are necessary to up-skilled the talents of the children\'s.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18403247_1413004985426901_2367617088384845402_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14900600_1210859692308099_4760640504443495436_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Design Thinking Workshop:</strong> In association with the team of INDES, a non-profit organisation based in the Delhi/NCR region, we conducted a workshop on Investigating designs for the kids.

The task is our step to provide the kids with an out of the box thinking capability and for the comprehensive development of the kids.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-660\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17361630_1649160552045760_7311229945647874152_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" /> <img class=\" wp-image-661 alignnone\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17362431_1649160612045754_5807452170966717960_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>3) Robotics:</strong> Makers Workshop by Mr. Harkrishan Singh and his team was organised for our kids at our Sector 51 pathshala. This workshop goal was to espouse the popular maker movement. Maker culture is a movement that embraces do-it-yourself tinkering with electronics and physical objects, it focuses on learning and trying out new practical skills, building a community of resources and experimenting. Through this kids start to understand how simple machines work and it also imparts them with problem solving skills and creativity. In our workshop kids were taught to make their own ARTBOTS that could draw for them. They made the BOTS with all that was available to them and some other electronic devices. Creativity flowed as we saw extensive varieties of BOTS. Kids started having so much fun that they did not realise how much they were learning through it. Instead of something static, you can get the pieces moving and that makes the activity way more amusing. Children were also taught about the basic electronic parts and how to set them up. Kids who learn how to plan and build structures and projects when they’re young can continue to apply these concepts as they’re exposed to more complex ideas. Credits to Mr. Ashish Sharma for the pictures and videos and to Ms. Meghna Bhutoria for connecting. At the end of the session all of the kids posed with their BOTS with pride.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-658\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"884\" height=\"662\" />\r\n<pre class=\"aLF-aPX-K0-aPE aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR\"></pre>','Up-Skilling','This is the excerpt for a featured post.','inherit','closed','closed','','154-revision-v1','','','2017-06-27 16:37:54','2017-06-27 16:37:54','',154,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/06/154-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(272,1,'2017-05-25 14:33:19','2017-05-25 14:33:19','<h4>Roshan Kumar Rawat</h4>\r\nMBA HR, MSW\r\n15yr Corporate Exposure as HR Professional.\r\nBuilding opportunities to educate construction workers kids.\r\n<h4>Shalini Bandooni<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-236\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Shalini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"121\" height=\"121\" /></h4>\r\nB.Sc Gold Medallist, B.ed 2005, Ex Teacher Govt College\r\nShe advise us on Academics\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <tg>Shalini Bandooni</th>\r\n    <th><img src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Shalini-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:150px; height:auto;\"></th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">B.Sc Gold Medallist, B.Ed 2005, Ex Teacher Govt College.<br> She advise us on Academics</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tanishk Bhardwaj</h4>\r\nSecurities Compliance | 100 Young Social Entrepreneurs of Color | Asian High Potential Young Leaders Invitee.\r\nHe advise us on Funding, Social Media and People Operations.\r\n<h4>Dr. Shesadev Nayak</h4>\r\nProfessor-School of Management, O P Jindal University.

And taking mind in that we do have lots of activities and check-ups of the children\'s .\n\nFollowing are some steps in the Health section is :-\n\n1) <b> EYE CHECK-UPS:-</b> Freepathshala has done eye check up for the children after every four months with proper machinery and medicines from the eye specialized doctor.\n<div>\n\nTo start off the month of October\'16 our team in association with <strong>The team of Eye Q vision organised a eye checkup camp</strong>. Regardless of age or physical health, it is important for everyone to have regular eye examinations. Regular tests are one of the best ways to protect vision because it can detect eye problems at their earliest stage, when they’re most treatable. Our kids are generally not able to afford such regular checkups and thus a lot of genetic diseases remain undetected which could otherwise be treated easily.\n\nThere were <strong>78 families</strong> and <strong>40 kids</strong> who were examined. Prescriptions were provided and the kids were advised to eat of lot of green vegetables to keep their eye health under check. According to the <strong>World Health Organisation</strong>, a massive <strong>80%</strong> of all blindness is preventable and having a simple eye test on a regular basis really does make all the difference. By looking into the eyes, optician may be able to see blood vessel leaks or swelling macular which are early signs of diabetes. Similarly, they may be able to detect the early stages of glaucoma or cataracts. Such facts lead to the necessity of providing our kids with periodic checkups to prevent further complications and thus are absolutely essential.\n<div><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-671\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG-20170629-WA0004.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"516\" /></div>\n</div>\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14441085_1186200824773986_2319920063021912168_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\n\n2) <b> YOGA:- </b> Regular exercise and morning exercise with the yoga instructor to maintain harmony and peace in the mind plus make them physically strong.\n\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14639628_1223130211081047_1549998528076974194_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\n\n3)<b>Good Touch and Bad Touch:-</b> In today’s times, we hear a lot about child abuse and molestation. Each one of us want our children to be safe and secure and to protect them against all odds that come their way. As kids grow up, they start meeting new people they don\'t know and fall prey to immoral minds. Most of the time, targets are very young children, below 6-7 years of age. They are too young to understand the difference between right and wrong. It’s high time, we start teaching young children about “Good Touch Bad Touch” to help prevent more damage. In association with the team of Hope Initiative, we decided to expound our kids about this topic. The kids were taught how to know if some person can cause them harm or already mistreats them and the measures that they could take in case they though that the person can cause them harm. Since their parents leave the house early in the morning to reach the construction site, there are many times the kids are left alone at home. Which is the time when we think the kids are the most susceptible to damage. This becomes our responsibility to equip and sensitise them to face any situation or person before the harm is done. We must all try to ensure that every kid becomes physically and emotionally strong to face every situation that must come their way.\n\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16266221_1302941039766630_7458161962520732968_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\n\n3)<strong>Meal Distribution Drive</strong><b>:- </b>With the group of Aaokhilayen Gurgaon team, we organise nutritious meals for the kids every Saturday. The meal include fruits ,like bananas ,and milk. A sumptuous repast is quiet essential in the early stages of childhood to check on the overall development of the kids. Malnutrition rates for India are extremely high, with about 38.4 per cent of children being stunted and 46 per cent underweight (National Family Health Survey, 2005-06).

Investigating designs is usually a detailed research performed which includes collecting data, the path to be followed and then analyzing the gathered information using designs and architectures. The students were required to build a roadmap that they follow to reach the pathshala each morning from their respective houses. The goal of the activity was to drive the already available knowledge to the kids to make substantial conclusions whenever required, to push their minds to ponder over other ways to solve a problem. The roadmap would help the kids think of other possible ways of reaching the pathshala if any one of the route is blocked due to some reason. It may also help them guide people to either the pathshala or their houses. If a situation arises that the kid is lost in the city, the design would help him identify the possible routes to reach his destination. The activity was performed in the month of march in HUDA park. The students counted trees in the region by drawing circles and also drafted a pathway from the park with the elements that they usually spot on the way. The task is our step to provide the kids with an out of the box thinking capability and for the comprehensive development of the kids.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-658\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"884\" height=\"662\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-660\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17361630_1649160552045760_7311229945647874152_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"304\" height=\"404\" /> <img class=\" wp-image-661 alignnone\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/17362431_1649160612045754_5807452170966717960_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" />','Up-Skilling','This is the excerpt for a featured post.','inherit','closed','closed','','154-revision-v1','','','2017-06-27 15:10:01','2017-06-27 15:10:01','',154,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/06/154-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(384,1,'2017-05-27 13:33:08','2017-05-27 13:33:08','<table style=\"width: 541px; height: 158px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h4>Roshan Kumar Rawat   <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RoshanKRawat\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://facebookbrand.com/wp-content/themes/fb-branding/prj-fb-branding/assets/images/fb-art.png\" alt=\"Facebook\" width=\"19\" height=\"19\" /></a>  <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/roshankrawat\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://rs1053.pbsrc.com/albums/s479/damianfeijoo/Icons/Linkedin.gif~c200\" alt=\"Linkedin\" width=\"19\" height=\"19\" /></a></h4>\r\nMBA HR, MSW\r\n15yr Corporate Exposure as HR Professional.\r\nBuilding opportunities to educate construction workers kids.</td>\r\n<td><img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/12572943_1214788408550385_2552700116127601171_n.jpg\" alt=\"Roshan\" width=\"122\" height=\"121\" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table style=\"width: 541px; height: 158px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h4>SHALINI BANDOONI</h4>\r\nB.Sc Gold Medallist, B.Ed 2005, Ex Teacher Govt College\r\nShe advise us on Academics</td>\r\n<td> <img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Shalini.jpg\" alt=\"Shalini\" width=\"121\" height=\"121\" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table style=\"width: 551px; height: 160px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h4>Tanishk Bhardwaj</h4>\r\nSecurities Compliance | 100 Young Social Entrepreneurs of Color |\r\nAsian High Potential Young Leaders Invitee.\r\nHe advise us on Funding, Social Media and People Operations.</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table style=\"width: 551px; height: 160px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h4>Dr. Shesadev Nayak</h4>\r\nProfessor-School of Management, O P Jindal University.\r\nEx Dean, Inter science Institute of Management &amp; Technology.\r\nEx Dean JIMS Delhi\r\nHe advises us in General admiration.</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table style=\"width: 551px; height: 160px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h4>Chander Thareja</h4>\r\nFounder &amp; CEO www.Donateitems.in\r\nEx Vice President - Royal Bank of Scotland - Markets &amp;\r\nInternational Banking\r\nHe advise us on IT infrastructure</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table style=\"width: 551px; height: 160px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h4>UCC &amp; Associates LLP, Accounting Advisor</h4>\r\nUCC &amp; Associates LLP (Formerly Umesh Chand &amp; Co.) commenced operations in\r\nIndia on July 13, 1991 under the able leadership and guidance of Umesh Chand Goyal, the founder and senior most partner of the Firm.

Investigating designs is usually a detailed research performed which includes collecting data, the path to be followed and then analyzing the gathered information using designs and architectures. The students were required to build a roadmap that they follow to reach the pathshala each morning from their respective houses. The goal of the activity was to drive the already available knowledge to the kids to make substantial conclusions whenever required, to push their minds to ponder over other ways to solve a problem. The roadmap would help the kids think of other possible ways of reaching the pathshala if any one of the route is blocked due to some reason. It may also help them guide people to either the pathshala or their houses.

Investigating designs is usually a detailed research performed which includes collecting data, the path to be followed and then analyzing the gathered information using designs and architectures. The students were required to build a roadmap that they follow to reach the pathshala each morning from their respective houses. The goal of the activity was to drive the already available knowledge to the kids to make substantial conclusions whenever required, to push their minds to ponder over other ways to solve a problem. The roadmap would help the kids think of other possible ways of reaching the pathshala if any one of the route is blocked due to some reason. It may also help them guide people to either the pathshala or their houses. If a situation arises that the kid is lost in the city, the design would help him identify the possible routes to reach his destination. The activity was performed in the month of march in HUDA park. The students counted trees in the region by drawing circles and also drafted a pathway from the park with the elements that they usually spot on the way.

And taking mind in that we do have lots of activities and check-ups of the children\'s .\r\n\r\nFollowing are some steps in the Health section is :-\r\n\r\n1) <b> EYE CHECK-UPS:-</b> Freepathshala has done eye check up for the children after every four months with proper machinery and medicines from the eye specialized doctor.\r\n\r\n \r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14441085_1186200824773986_2319920063021912168_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n2) <b> YOGA:- </b> Regular exercise and morning exercise with the yoga instructor to maintain harmony and peace in the mind plus make them physically strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14639628_1223130211081047_1549998528076974194_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n\r\n3)<b>Good Touch and Bad Touch:-</b> In today’s times, we hear a lot about child abuse and molestation. Each one of us want our children to be safe and secure and to protect them against all odds that come their way. As kids grow up, they start meeting new people they don\'t know and fall prey to immoral minds. Most of the time, targets are very young children, below 6-7 years of age. They are too young to understand the difference between right and wrong. It’s high time, we start teaching young children about “Good Touch Bad Touch” to help prevent more damage. In association with the team of Hope Initiative, we decided to expound our kids about this topic. The kids were taught how to know if some person can cause them harm or already mistreats them and the measures that they could take in case they though that the person can cause them harm. Since their parents leave the house early in the morning to reach the construction site, there are many times the kids are left alone at home. Which is the time when we think the kids are the most susceptible to damage. This becomes our responsibility to equip and sensitise them to face any situation or person before the harm is done. We must all try to ensure that every kid becomes physically and emotionally strong to face every situation that must come their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16266221_1302941039766630_7458161962520732968_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\r\n','Health','This is the excerpt for your very first post.','inherit','closed','closed','','5-revision-v1','','','2017-07-03 07:38:39','2017-07-03 07:38:39','',5,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/07/5-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(524,1,'2017-06-02 09:57:48','2017-06-02 09:57:48','/*\nYou can add your own CSS here.\n\nClick the help icon above to learn more.\n*/\na:link {\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n\na:visited {\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n','karuna-wpcom','','publish','closed','closed','','karuna-wpcom','','','2017-06-02 09:57:48','2017-06-02 09:57:48','',0,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/06/karuna-wpcom/',0,'custom_css','',0),(525,1,'2017-06-02 09:57:48','2017-06-02 09:57:48','/*\nYou can add your own CSS here.\n\nClick the help icon above to learn more.\n*/\na:link {\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n\na:visited {\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n','karuna-wpcom','','inherit','closed','closed','','524-revision-v1','','','2017-06-02 09:57:48','2017-06-02 09:57:48','',524,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/06/524-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(526,1,'2017-06-02 09:58:47','2017-06-02 09:58:47','&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Freepathshala is an initiative to educate children of construction workers.</strong></p>\r\n<b>FREEPATHSHALA HEADOFFICE:</b>\r\nADDRESS: FLAT NO.555 FF, HOUSING BOARD COLONY, SECTOR 51, GURGAON, HARYANA, INDIA.\r\nWEBSITE: FREEPATHSHALA.ORG\r\nFacebook:<a style=\"color: #008000;\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Freepathshala\">https://www.facebook.com/Freepathshala</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a style=\"color: #008000;\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshankrawat/\">Roshan Kumar Rawat</a>\r\n\r\nEmail: <a style=\"color: white;\" href=\"mailto:roshan@freepathshala.org\">roshan@freepathshala.org</a>\r\nPhone Number:7838883008','contact us','','inherit','closed','closed','','39-revision-v1','','','2017-06-02 09:58:47','2017-06-02 09:58:47','',39,'http://t12pathshala.co.nf/2017/06/39-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(527,1,'2017-06-02 10:30:12','2017-06-02 10:30:12','<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n  \r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\r\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\r\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\r\n  <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\r\n  <style>\r\n  body {\r\n      font: 400 15px Lato, sans-serif;\r\n      line-height: 1.8;\r\n      color: #818181;\r\n  }\r\n  h2 {\r\n      font-size: 24px;\r\n      text-transform: uppercase;\r\n      color: #303030;\r\n      font-weight: 600;\r\n      margin-bottom: 30px;\r\n  }\r\n  h4 {\r\n      font-size: 19px;\r\n      line-height: 1.375em;\r\n      color: #303030;\r\n      font-weight: 400;\r\n      margin-bottom: 30px;\r\n  }  \r\n  .jumbotron {\r\n      background-color: #f4511e;\r\n      color: #fff;\r\n      padding: 100px 25px;\r\n      font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;\r\n  }\r\n  .container-fluid {\r\n      padding: 60px 50px;\r\n  }\r\n  .bg-grey {\r\n      background-color: #f6f6f6;\r\n  }\r\n  .logo-small {\r\n      color: #f4511e;\r\n      font-size: 50px;\r\n  }\r\n  .logo {\r\n      color: #f4511e;\r\n      font-size: 200px;\r\n  }\r\n  .thumbnail {\r\n      padding: 0 0 15px 0;\r\n      border: none;\r\n      border-radius: 0;\r\n  }\r\n  .thumbnail img {\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      margin-bottom: 10px;\r\n  }\r\n  .carousel-control.right, .carousel-control.left {\r\n      background-image: none;\r\n      color: #f4511e;\r\n  }\r\n  .carousel-indicators li {\r\n      border-color: #f4511e;\r\n  }\r\n  .carousel-indicators li.active {\r\n      background-color: #f4511e;\r\n  }\r\n  .item h4 {\r\n      font-size: 19px;\r\n      line-height: 1.375em;\r\n      font-weight: 400;\r\n      font-style: italic;\r\n      margin: 70px 0;\r\n  }\r\n  .item span {\r\n      font-style: normal;\r\n  }\r\n  .panel {\r\n      border: 1px solid #f4511e;

element of visual communication, we need to think through how and why we are using it. The way we use different colors has a dramatic impact on how we subconsciously relate to objects.  Our Sector 51 Pathshala received a new avatar from Ms. Shikha , Ms. Reena and the volunteers of the team \"Udaan Ek Metha Sapna\" where graffiti were painted on all the walls of the pathshala. The walls were decorated with the pictures of animals portraying different stories and with kids holding out numbers and alphabets. Even the outer walls of the garden were painted with the figures of education. The walls typically spoke of allegories through images. Colors in kids\' surroundings help boost activity, orange has shown to increase performance, yellow increases emotion of joy, blue helps create a state of relaxation and calmness. A creative environment leads to creative minds.<strong>\n</strong></li>\n</ol>\n[video width=\"400\" height=\"224\" mp4=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18998465_297875697320168_6425362295626399744_n.mp4\"][/video]\n\nStarted Today 3rd Freepathshala in Gurgaon.\n\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18527702_1418505301543536_6298244914611962087_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\n\n<img class=\"wrap align-right\" src=\"http://t12pathshala.co.nf/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18664365_1418505331543533_3905917840798252670_n.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1001\" />\n\nThis is 2nd Freepathshala in sector 46.\n1.
